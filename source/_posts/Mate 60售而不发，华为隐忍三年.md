## Yu Chengdong "reneged on his word".

In August 2020, Yu Chengdong said, "Huawei's world-leading Kirin series of chips can not be manufactured after 15 September, will become extinct."

In July 2022, Yu Chengdong added, "Huawei, as the global leader in 5G, is the only manufacturer selling 4G phones in the 5G era, which is a joke."

On 29 August 2023, the Huawei Mate 60 Pro went on sale ahead of schedule without any preview or official launch. And according to CCTV News, semiconductor industry watchdog TechInsights says the Huawei Mate 60 Pro is powered by the new Kirin 9000s chip with advanced 7nm and 5G support.

Kirin hasn't become extinct, and Huawei is back to 5G. Yu Chengdong's once despondent words are mirrored in another form today as Huawei goes through three years.

How long is three years? It is approximately equal to the replacement cycle of a smartphone today, comparable to the time it took TSMC to upgrade from a 5nm process to 3nm, and is the journey from the beginning to the end of a viral storm that swept the world. After that, there may be a new metric - the time it took Huawei to tackle the self-research and self-production of the Kirin chip.

Although in the 25 September Huawei conference, Yu Chengdong still did not release and introduce the Mate 60 series, just with a sentence "Pioneer plan products, I will not be introduced here" a pass. But everyone knows that Huawei has gone through the most difficult time.

The world loves the story of a brave man who has gone through trials and tribulations, travelled over thousands of mountains, and achieved success. Over the past three years, Huawei all the stoicism seems to be for today, Yu Chengdong and his words on behalf of Huawei has become a kind of alternative story of the times, which contains business, politics, science and technology, public opinion ...... countless complex elements intertwined in the body of the company.

In 2021, Yu Chengdong said, "Huawei mobile phones will return to the king in 2023." Now that Kirin has returned, and mobile phones have returned, how far is Huawei from the real "return of the king"?

Before the soldiers and horses move, food and grass first. Before the Kirin chip back to normal, Huawei obviously can not sit back and wait until everything is ready to start a full return.

In April last year, Yu Chengdong said, "Last year (2021) we had a difficult supply of mobile phones, (this year) we have good news, our Huawei mobile phone supply has been greatly improved, and this year Huawei mobile phones began to come back. So people want to buy Huawei products, Huawei mobile phones can be bought."

But Huawei's biggest problem is that, after several years of 5G infestation, consumers mostly hold the idea of "I can not use, but you can not do without" for 5G, the user's recognition of 4G mobile phones is not high. Naturally, Huawei mobile phones that can not support 5G are also much less attractive. Therefore, even if Huawei gradually restored the mobile phone supply chain, but the sales did not grow much.

According to market research agency Omdia, Huawei shipped 125 million mobile phones in 2020, 35 million in 2021, and sales in 2022 fell to 28 million.

## It's only into 2023 that the good news for Huawei's mobile phones starts to really come.

In June this year, there is news that Huawei has raised its 2023 mobile phone shipment target to 40 million, while Huawei set this target at the beginning of the year to 30 million. In this regard, Huawei sources told reporters, "We did raise the mobile phone shipment target this year, but the specific number is not convenient to disclose."

At that time, the outside world is still very difficult to peek at the bottom of Huawei's upward sales target. But soon, Huawei's bottom line is revealed.

According to IDC data, in the second quarter of this year, Huawei's mobile phone market share jumped 76.1%, from 7.3% in the same period last year to 13%, tied with millet for fifth place in the country.

By early July this year, three third-party technology research firms covering the Chinese smartphone industry said Huawei was planning to return to the 5G smartphone industry by the end of the year.

So, at the end of August, we saw the surprise "Mate 60 Pro sold before release". Although Huawei has not announced the Mate 60 chip information, but CCTV news reports indicate that the Mate 60 is undoubtedly a 5G mobile phone equipped with Kirin chip. The normal release of the Mate 60 series also means that Huawei is back to normal in the mobile phone business and is starting to regain lost ground in a big way.

A digital blogger broke the news that in just half a month, the Mate 60 series' sales of the Pro model alone rivalled the sales of all the models in the entire Mate 50 series combined (Huawei Mall only). As of 13 September, the Huawei Mate 60 Pro has exceeded 1.1 million activations across all channels alone.

And supply chain data shows that in the 36th week of September 4-10, Huawei's mobile phone sales accounted for 17% of the total, ranking second in the domestic smartphone market, only 0.2 percentage points lower than the first-ranked glory.

Tianfeng International analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the Mate 60 series has been in strong demand since its launch on 29 August, and shipments are expected to rise to about 6 million units in the second half of this year.

In addition, Huawei's Mate 60 Pro and Mate 60 Pro+ shipments have been revised upwards to 20 million units, IT Times learnt from industry chain sources.

Now, it is no longer the demand but the production capacity that is blocking the footsteps of the Mate 60 series. Since going on sale on 28 August, both the Mate 60 series and the folding screen Mate X5 are subject to a limited time rush, or offline advance booking. Meanwhile, third-party platforms have increased prices by as little as hundreds or as much as thousands of yuan.

Of course, despite the hot sales of the Mate 60 series, Huawei's mobile phone business still has a long way to go before the "return of the king". In 2019, Huawei mobile phone (including glory) shipments reached a peak of 240 million units, ranking second in the world after Samsung. Even if Huawei is able to achieve the sales target of 40 million units this year, it is still only 1/6 of the peak.

Therefore, Huawei mobile phone to restore the past glory, only with the Mate 60 a starting price of 5,499 yuan of high-end mobile phone is far from enough, but also need a huge low-end models.

In the past, glory took on most of Huawei's low-end and mid-range market, and glory shipments in 2019 reached 59 million units, accounting for 24.6% of Huawei's shipments that year. But in 2020, the glory was sold, and the relationship with Huawei was completely severed. Not long ago there were rumours that Honor could return to Huawei, but Honor CEO Zhao said explicitly that the rumour was "absolutely impossible".

## So if Huawei wants to make a comeback, it's going to have to go back to Glory and pick up where it left off.

Digital blogger "fixed focus digital" broke the news that Huawei nova 12 will be equipped with a Kirin 830 mid-range processor, while the nova 12 Pro is equipped with a higher-end Kirin 9000S processor. This means that Huawei may already be planning to return to the low-end market.

In addition to the low-end and mid-range markets, the overseas market has been an important support for Huawei in the past to become the second in the world. in 2019, of the 240 million units of Huawei's mobile phone shipments, nearly 100 million units were contributed by the overseas market. The problem now is that Google will no longer allow Huawei to use Google's GMS service from 2019 onwards, and even if Huawei goes overseas again, the acceptance of overseas users remains unknown.

In short, the Mate 60 can be said to have fired the first shot of Huawei's mobile phone business "return of the king", but Huawei still has a long way to go in order to restore the past peak.

Compared to the mobile phone business has been struggling in recent years, Huawei's other businesses are recovering faster. According to Huawei's financial report, Huawei achieved global sales revenue of 642.3 billion yuan in 2022, up 0.9% year-on-year, while the previous year (2021) Huawei's annual revenue slipped by 28.56% to 636.8 billion yuan; net profit of 35.6 billion yuan, net profit margin of 5.5%.

Specifically for the three major BGs (business groups), the terminal business, in which mobile phones are located, achieved sales revenue of 214.5 billion yuan in 2022, a year-on-year decline of 11.87%. While the other two major businesses both achieved growth, with sales revenue of 284 billion yuan in the carrier business area, up 0.89% year-on-year, and sales revenue of 133.2 billion yuan in the enterprise business, up 30% year-on-year.

It can be seen that although the mobile phone business has been hit, the stabilisation of the other two major businesses has helped Huawei reverse the downward trend in 2021. In particular, the high-speed growth of the enterprise business has somewhat compensated for the reduction in revenue caused by the decline of the mobile phone business.

And, although revenue and profits are both under pressure, Huawei's investment in R & D is still "big". 2022 Huawei's R & D investment increased by 14% year-on-year to 161.5 billion yuan, accounting for 25.1% of the annual revenue, and the cumulative R & D expenditure for ten years has exceeded 977.3 billion yuan.

Commenting on last year's performance, Huawei's rotating chairman, Xu Zhijun, said, "Looking back at 2022, the severe external environment and non-market factors continued to affect the company's operations. Being in the midst of a storm, we are continuing to run, working hard to secure business continuity and ensure support and service for our customers; we are also striving to fight more 'grain' so that we can both survive and lay the foundation for future growth."

At the end of August this year, Huawei also announced its 2023 semi-annual report, in the first half of this year, Huawei achieved revenue of 308.29 billion yuan, compared with 298.68 billion yuan in the same period of the previous year, an increase of 3.2% year-on-year, accelerated by 2.3 percentage points compared with last year's annual growth rate of 0.9%; the first half of the year's net profit of 46.523 billion yuan, compared with the same period of the previous year's 14.629 billion yuan, an increase of 218% year-on-year. At the same time, in the first half of this year, Huawei's research and development expenses reached 82.604 billion yuan, an increase of 3.541 billion yuan.

It can be seen that Huawei's revenue and profit in the first half of this year achieved double growth, and the growth rate is significantly higher than last year, showing that Huawei's growth is accelerating.

Hongmeng is also growing rapidly, said Yu Chengdong at the conference, Hongmeng 4 was released for one month, and the number of users has exceeded 60 million. In addition, the overall number of users of the Hongmeng ecosystem has also exceeded 700 million users, becoming the world's third largest mobile smart ecosystem. At the conference, Yu also said that Hongmeng native apps are coming soon. This likely signals that Hongmeng will get rid of its compatibility with the Android ecosystem and truly build its own ecosystem from the bottom up.

At present, Huawei's most uncertain is the car business. So far this year, Huawei Car BU's most important partner, Ask Auto, has had poor sales, and the overall performance of the automotive business has not been bright.

In 2022, Huawei's car BU business revenue was $2.1 billion, and in the first half of this year it was $1 billion. But since the establishment of the intelligent car solutions business, Huawei has invested more than 21 billion yuan, and the research and development team has reached the size of 7,000 people. 1 billion in revenue is obviously difficult to support Huawei's heavy investment.

However, Huawei's automotive business has also ushered in a new burst of money.On 13 September, the new Ask M7 was released, with a big drop of 70,000 yuan in its starting price and a 50,000 yuan drop in its average selling price. Yu Chengdong said at the conference that the new Askworld M7, which has been on the market for less than half a month, has more than 20,000 large orders.

In addition, Huawei and Chery, JAC, Changan and other car companies to cooperate with the model is also in normal progress, is expected next year there will be more equipped with Huawei automotive technology of the new models listed, then, Huawei automotive business may be able to get rid of too much dependence on the ask world situation.

At the start of the 25 September launch, Huawei played a song called "My Dream", which is the theme song of Huawei's consumer business brand. There is a line in the lyrics: all the time all the way forward, crazy world, meet the pain in the eyes of all the dreams, are given to time, want to fly with all your heart, who does not experience woe, I think I will ignore the grey of disappointment, embrace the beauty of regret.

It is not uncommon for commercial companies to use sentiment to package their products and build their brands, but Huawei seems to be one of the exceptions, and it is difficult to be copied or learnt from.

Whether it's Ren Zhengfei's perception of crisis or Huawei's dedication to research and development, both reflect the company's distinctiveness in the business world. They tend to follow the laws of the economy while breaking business practices and solving problems in unconventional ways at "inopportune" times. For example, Ren Zhengfei's famous article "Huawei's Winter", such as the return of the Mate 60.

It is probably for this reason that Ren Zhengfei has a rather special status among Chinese entrepreneurs, as Liu Qiangdong said, "He is my idol"; Wang Tao, founder of DJI, said, "Only himself and Ren Zhengfei can be regarded as rare smart people"; Wang Shi commented that Ren is the "fox of North Africa" and "the fox of North Africa". "the fox of North Africa".

After this battle, Huawei and Ren Zhengfei are bound to become a colourful part of China's business history again.

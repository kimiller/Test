## iPhone 15 overheating? Nothing to do with TSMC 3nm!

Since the release of the iPhone 15 series, there has been no shortage of negative rumours related to it on the web, and while the authenticity of these rumours remains to be proven, the impact has been felt, which has led to a number of netizens being quite critical of the new series.

Nevertheless, the new iPhone is still in short supply, and the delivery date for some models has even been delayed until November, while those who rushed to buy the iPhone 15 in the first batch have been able to get their hands on it.

Some of the first batch of users in the actual use of the new machine found that there may be a heating problem, especially the iPhone 15Pro, this model is more prone to overheating, and thus the Internet began to rumour that this is the new machine debut of the 3nm process chip process immaturity caused by.

In this regard, Ming-Chi Kuo, a renowned analyst at Tianfeng Group, has given an explanation, stating that the iPhone 15Pro's heating problem is not related to TSMC's 3nm process, but is caused by other reasons that cause the device to overheat.

Upon the analyst's investigation, he believes that Apple may have compromised the design of the cooling system in order to allow the iPhone 15Pro to further reduce its weight, coupled with the fact that the new titanium alloy material does not have a very strong thermal conductivity, which naturally makes the cooling effect less than ideal.

In fact, this is a clich√©d topic, Apple designed the iPhone's internal structure is compact, closed body space is difficult to increase the cooling area, not to mention that Apple has never installed a cooling system as a solution to the problem, but rather to mobile phone processor energy efficiency and the software side of the start to work.

Kuo expects Apple to address the issue in a similar way, by updating the system to reduce overheating in the new models.

However, the analyst says not to get your hopes up, as this approach will always be limited unless Apple reduces the performance of its processors, in which case it will have more to lose than to gain.

To sum up, the rumour that TSMC's 3nm A17 Pro chip is the main culprit is unfounded, and is just another rumour that has been circulating.

In fact, models before the iPhone 15 can sometimes overheat, but this situation usually occurs in the process of charging, because fast charging inevitably leads to the motherboard hot or play too long will also lead to the body hot, it is recommended to take a break and then play it again is good!

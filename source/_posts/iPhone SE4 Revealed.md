## iPhone SE4 Revealed! Appearance has been drastically changed.

The iPhone SE series, as one of Apple's popular products, can make up for the vacancies of small-screen models, but also has good hardware specifications, so it has always been very popular with consumers.

Not long ago, there was news that the iPhone SE4 would be launched in 2025 as Apple's first device with a self-developed 5G baseband.

In the initial projections, this model was to be launched in 2024, but due to Apple's 5G modem development progress can not keep up with the expected, so had to postpone the plan.

Today, foreign technology media MacRumors brought us more specific breaking news about the iPhone SE4, unlike in the past, the hardware specifications of this model and the appearance of the design will appear more obvious changes, may be able to arouse the interest of more users.

First of all, the appearance of the iPhone SE4 will be basically the same as the iPhone 14, and even the former's internal testing will retain the test parameters of the iPhone 14, the follow-up test Apple may also be adjusted.

Some of the cosmetic changes from this year's iPhone 15 series are also expected to be carried over to the iPhone SE4, such as the user-customisable action button, a change that also means the mute button will gradually become a thing of the past.

The lightnning port will also be a thing of the past, and the USB-C port will be a big change for this model, as it seems to be the trend for Apple to change ports nowadays, which is a last resort in order to comply with EU laws.

In terms of camera specs, the iPhone SE4 may come with a 4800W pixel rear camera, and the flash will be positioned similarly to its predecessor, although the exact camera appearance may still undergo certain changes.

As for the Touch ID Home button, it should have been cancelled completely, after all, the iPhone SE4 has shifted towards the iPhone 14 in terms of appearance. But what goes around comes around, and in return for giving up Touch ID comes the more convenient Face ID biometrics.

It's worth noting that MacRumors doesn't confirm that the iPhone SE4 will be the first to come with Apple's own 5G baseband, and if Apple sees it as the first to test a 5G modem, it won't need to update the camera or action buttons or other important changes for this model.

As the first bangs-screen model in the SE series, it's already very cost-effective to get this kind of boost, but the model is still in the early stages of development, so it's still very likely that Apple will make some tweaks to it in the follow-up.

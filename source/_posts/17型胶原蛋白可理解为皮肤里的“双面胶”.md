## Hair loss star" is saved again.

In the past few years, under the media and brand "bombardment" of market education, we are no longer unfamiliar with collagen, which has become a synonym for "youthfulness" and "full of vitality". It has almost become a synonym for "youthfulness" and "full of energy". Now, in addition to "face", it is also "head".

In 2016, the key role of XVII collagen (hereinafter referred to as "type 17") in hair follicle aging was first reported by Science; in 2019, the study of type 17's involvement in the regulation of epidermal stem cells to rejuvenate the skin was published in Nature; and in 2021, the role of type 17 in the regulation of the fate of hair follicle stem cells and the regulation of the fate of hair follicle stem cells was reported in Nature. The regulatory role and mechanism of type 17 in hair follicle stem cell fate was also confirmed and published in a Nature sub-journal.

This series of "top publications" has made the industry excited, because in the field of anti-hair loss, few active ingredients have really been confirmed by the authority, and there are only a few products on the market such as finasteride and minoxidil. The self-deprecating "dandelion on earth" young people should have a very good feeling about this.

The industry has begun to increase the type 17 collagen, trying to compete for the anti-hair loss market, which has never been involved in the market before, in addition to cosmetics and medical aesthetics. And with everyone piling on type III recombinant collagen today, it also wants to develop new categories to seek differentiation.

Since the beginning of this year, companies such as Far Thinking Bio (using raw materials from Unnamed Gleanings), Jinbo Bio, and Chuangjian Medical have released their Type 17 collagen products to the public one after another, and Giant Bio is in the process of preparing for it, making it an important wind vane for the industry. Chen Jiayue, co-founder of Unnamed Gleaner, said, "It is estimated that by next year, we will see a bunch of type 17 collagen products on the market".

## The "double-sided glue" in the skin

To date, humans have discovered at least 28 types of collagen (based on homology and biological function), which vary in structure and content in the body, with type 1, type 2, and type 3 collagen accounting for the largest and most thoroughly researched.

- collagen is tightly packed and relatively hard, and mainly plays a role in shaping and supporting the body;

- collagen repairs and lubricates damaged cartilage;

- collagen has a large elasticity in its tissue composition and is mainly used to support the softness of the skin, which will be more delicate and supple after filling;

The speciality of type 17 collagen is that it is a kind of transmembrane collagen, whose N-terminal end is located in the cytoplasm and C-terminal end is located in the extracellular matrix, and it will assist in the formation of semi-bridging particles between the basement membrane and the basal cells, which can lock the basement membrane and the basal cells firmly together (like a "double-sided adhesive tape"), maintain a complete and close state, and hinder the invasion of external microorganisms and harmful substances. In addition, it can anchor the stem cells "like a nail", and the epidermal stem cells rich in collagen type 17 will compete to remove the aging epidermal stem cells with less collagen type 17 to maintain the epidermis in a normal renewal and metabolism state.

In terms of content, generally mammals such as pigs, cows and sheep are more present with type 1, which accounts for roughly 80% of the total; followed by type 3, which accounts for 10-15% of the total; and the rest are very few, including type 17. These indicators also determine the cost and feasibility of their extraction by animal means. At present, type 1 collagen can be extracted by animals to get a good complete triple helix structure; type 3 collagen through animal extraction is more expensive, smaller yield, through genetically engineered bacteria fermentation technology to extract (i.e., recombinant collagen) is gradually becoming a mainstream.

By contrast, "Type 17, with its minuscule amount and non-extracellular secretory collagen, is almost impractical to extract through animals and must be expressed by 'recombinant' means." Xinliang Wang, a partner at Minfeng Capital, said that also because natural type 17 collagen is a complex structure consisting of 1,497 amino acids, it is difficult to synthesise full-length, full-function type 17 collagen by existing methods, and more often than not, the corresponding functional domains are selected on proteins to express the corresponding functions.

## Production process of recombinant XVII collagen 

Why is it so complex? Simply put, type 17 collagen has a triple helix, a trimer, an active tail and a transmembrane structural domain. "It has a lot of parts, and it's easy to synthesise a bunch of them, but they also have to be assembled in the right way to make sure it's functional," says Chen Jiayue as an analogy.

Xinliang Wang said that the difficulty in synthesising collagen type 17 comes from three aspects: firstly, selecting functional domains and ensuring the length, "which is very much a reflection of the academic level of the teams"; secondly, selecting the appropriate expression platform and breaking through the ensuing process challenges, "for example, the high concentration of collagen after expression needs to avoid enzymatic degradation. Secondly, selecting the appropriate expression platform and breaking through the ensuing process challenges, "such as avoiding enzymatic degradation after expression"; finally, there are the usual challenges such as purification.

Li Haihang, CTO of Tron Healthcare, told 36 Krypton, "From sequence design, expression screening, production process (fermentation and purification) to determine the effectiveness of the validation of the entire process is like a new drug R & D, the cost of more than a hundred million; but because we already have a more mature R & D and production of conversion process and equipment and facilities to share, the relative cost of the amortisation of a little lower, but it is also a ten million records. "

How to evaluate a good recombinant type 17 collagen? According to Wang Xinliang, there are several main indicators: sufficiently complete expression of functional domains, good enough cell adhesion and cell migration of the product, as well as the correct three-dimensional structure and sufficient purity to reflect the downstream function. If it is treated as a raw material to examine, the brand will often be screened through the "head-to-head" comparison, and may even do cell experiments to support its function.

## "Anti-hair loss" is the new blue ocean

In the past, because it is difficult to obtain through traditional animal extraction, the market has not been a large number of applications of type 17 collagen; today, genetic recombination technology to help achieve large-scale mass production and functional stability, the direct benefit is that the majority of the "hair loss star" is saved.

Data from China's National Health Commission shows that more than 250 million people in China suffer from hair loss, and hair loss is showing a trend of youthfulness, which means that an average of 6 people in the country have 1 person with hair loss problems. According to the relevant research report, for this large group, in 2030 China's hair health market size or more than 200 billion yuan.

Past studies have fully supported the role of type 17 collagen in hair follicles: maintaining the activity of hair follicle stem cells, preventing follicle miniaturisation; maintaining the homeostasis of melanin stem cells, preventing the generation of grey hair: removing senescent cells from the scalp, achieving a healthy scalp.

Hair grows from the hair follicle, through which it absorbs nutrients from the body. Aging or damaged hair follicles can lead to many problems, including baldness (immune system attacks hair follicles), seborrheic alopecia (dihydrotestosterone attack leads to follicle miniaturisation), inflammatory alopecia (Staphylococcus aureus infection leads to folliculitis, which clogs up the follicles), stress alopecia (follicle stem cell activity decreases, hairs are not able to re-grow after they fall out), and scalp senescence (scalp laxity and senescence with microcirculation disorders), to name a few. . The root cause of aging or damage to hair follicles is collagen type 17 deficiency. This means that direct supplementation of collagen type 17 has a direct and definitive effect.

Previously, there have been so few products on the market that have been proven to be truly effective that everyone is extremely excited about the emergence of new potent ingredients. Typically, based on the Type 17 recombinant collagen produced by Genuine Healthcare ("Yusheng Zhiqi"), Barley Hair Transplant has already been conducting relevant clinical studies.

According to Du Zhenbo, director of Chengdu branch of barley micro-needle hair transplantation, the main purpose is to verify whether the effect of type 17 collagen is more significant in male hair loss, scalp anti-aging and other aspects compared with the traditional method, as well as the appropriate dosage and frequency, the method of administering the drug (smear, micro-needle, roller needle, injection, etc.), the need to apply the stage (initial treatment, consolidation of the treatment or in-depth treatment), etc., and is expected to carry out 100 full-linkage clinical cases, and the results will be published next year.

Zou Shuhong, president of Chongqing branch of barley micro-needle hair transplantation, introduced to 36 Krypton, the industry's conventional hair loss treatment means only "PRP mesotherapy" (PRP, platelet-rich plasma, refers to platelet-rich plasma), or the introduction of some of the scalp anti-aging cosmetics products. In contrast, type 17 collagen function is more direct (fast relief), and product compliance is also stable yield, as long as to meet the theory of maturity, the product is legal, the operation of the three prerequisites, "the market outlook should be better than other therapies".

In recent years, the hair transplant industry has seen a downturn in growth, is eager to open up the second curve, based on the effective product maintenance service has become an important hand, like the hospital to do "chronic disease management".

Cui Shaofang, founder of barley hair transplant, told 36 Krypton, the whole industry chain will develop in the direction of comprehensive treatment and personalized improvement, whether it is pure hair care, or to solve a variety of hair loss, hair texture, scalp itching, scalp oil and other hair problems, and even after hair transplantation after the maintenance, need to be carried out on a regular basis, and some of these patients may need a more long-term treatment plan, supported by the strong demand for these! Under the support of these strong demands, hair care has great room for growth.

On the pan-consumer side, the current technology of head care cosmetics is also developing from anti-dandruff to maintaining the micro-ecological balance of the scalp, preventing scalp inflammation and anti-hair loss. Brands are also paying attention to the current direction of relatively new technologies such as type 17 collagen, and are looking forward to adding them to their products. Chen Jiayue revealed that Unnamed Gleam already has ingredients ready to go to market, starting with a scalp serum.

To sum up, if the above research can be transformed into industry, it will definitely help recombinant collagen open up a new growth curve, especially in the blue ocean market where the demand for anti-hair loss is far from being met.

## Can we create a new favourite ingredient?

As we know, with the support of genetic recombination technology, type 1 and type 3 collagen has achieved large-scale mass production and cost reductions, and then become a large-scale use of cosmetics, medical and aesthetic, medical device raw materials for the industry has brought new opportunities for development. At present, the track also ran out of Jinbo biology, giant biology two listed companies.

Then 17-type recombinant collagen can become the next raw material "new favourite"? Chen Jiayue believes that, certainly, and even the life cycle will be longer than the "type 3", because "the overall stronger, more applications".

Wang Xinliang believes that "it is difficult to compare horizontally, type 17 can not be crosslinked like type 3 to do support, used in filling; but on the other hand, because of its efficacy in the hair follicle is clear, there will be another larger market."

He pointed out that type 17 recombinant collagen is in fact an extension of the recombinant collagen raw material exploration: the first step, recombinant collagen to reflect more of its amino acid composition and nutritional role, so it is mainly used in the "mesotherapy" (mesotherapy) and other scenarios; the second step, the recombinant collagen in the mechanical force to reflect the support of applications The second step is to show the application of recombinant collagen in mechanical support, so it can be used in the "filler" scenario; the third step is to show the "functional application" as a functional protein - such as anti-aging, anti-hair loss, which is also the key point for the future explosion of Type 17 recombinant collagen. Collagen can explode in the future key point.

"But it's still early for the C-suite to explode," Wang said. But as soon as the first (clinically-proven "arm" size) product hits the market, the time may come," said Wang Xinliang.

He said that the production of the raw material side has been completed, and is in the stage of instilling the concept to the brand; wait until the brand gradually accepts such a new ingredient, before it can be instilled to the C-suite consumers. He revealed that at present, type 17 collagen to enter into the brand supply chain system this will take time, "but cosmetics will certainly be faster than medical beauty."

Type 17 recombinant collagen future value in the hair field has been no need to say. When talking about the prospects for the application of more subdivided scenes, Wang Xinliang talked about, there is an effect is one thing, but how to better play the effect is another thing, which is also the industry in the direction of extensive exploration. "For such a large molecule, it is necessary to use the corresponding transdermal technology, such as roller microneedle and stamp microneedle, silicone-based microneedle; or use photoelectric equipment to open up the absorption channel, such as microneedle radiofrequency, laser, etc.; or with the help of transdermal ingredients or formulations to help the efficacy of collagen to reach the cells, such as liposomes."

So how to create a powerful explosive product? Wang Xinliang believes that it will be used in the "beauty" therapy such as hydration products, may create a new category. In the past, hydrafacial injections used some functional ingredients, such as vitamin C, glutathione and other small molecules, the general maintenance of a shorter period of time and the efficacy is not very clear; "this time if there is a mechanism is very clear, the birth of a new category of real effect, will certainly enhance the entire hydrafacial injection of customer satisfaction, to become a strong adhesion category of the organisation! ".

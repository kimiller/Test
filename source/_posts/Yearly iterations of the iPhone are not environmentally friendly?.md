## Yearly iterations of the iPhone are not environmentally friendly? Cook: It's cool!

Achieving carbon neutrality for all products by 2030 is an ambitious goal set by Apple, and it's undeniable that Apple is indeed striving towards this goal, not just talking about it.

This was re-emphasised at Apple's autumn launch event this year, and after the event, Apple CEO Tim Cook was interviewed by an overseas magazine, where he talked about iPhone content and the company's future plans.

The iPhone iterates every year, so sometimes the improvement between some iterations of the model will not be very big, and even there will always be a "toothpaste" voice here and there, but Apple still maintains such a speed of renewal, and do not waver, which is not against the environmental protection concept it has been advocating?

When Cook was asked about this, he said it's cool that Apple allows users who want a new phone to have a new option every year.

Apple also allows users to trade in their iPhones, so that devices that still work can be resold, and those that don't can be disassembled and the resulting materials can be reused. This shows that Apple's yearly updates are not in conflict with its environmental philosophy.

In addition, when talking about what degree of development of the iPhone by 2030, Cook confidently said that, from the environmental point of view, the iPhone at that time will fully achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, but the future direction of development Cook still chose to keep it a secret.

It's not easy for Apple to be labelled "carbon neutral", and if you're not careful, you'll be met with a lot of scepticism and even suspicion that it's just wearing the mantle of being environmentally friendly, while its actual actions are destroying the balance of the environment.

Apple's first carbon-neutral product, the Apple Watch Series 9, is evidence of this, with a significant reduction in the product's carbon footprint through electricity, materials, and transport, with the remaining carbon emissions offset through a carbon credit programme.

In addition to this, Cook personally tries to reduce carbon emissions in his life as much as possible, such as reducing the use of plastic bottles, driving an electric car for travelling, and participating in actions such as recycling and composting. It is believed that in this way, Cook will be able to better report his annual environmental efforts to Mother Nature next year.

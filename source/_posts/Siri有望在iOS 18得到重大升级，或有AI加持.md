## Siri is expected to get a major upgrade in iOS 18, or with AI support!

As the most important voice assistant of Apple products, Siri is able to achieve through the user voice commands, including making phone calls, sending text messages, checking the weather and other operations, but with the emergence of true artificial intelligence, Siri seems to be close to the edge of elimination.

In order to effectively solve this problem, Siri will carry out some "evolution". According to foreign technology media The Information reported that Apple is preparing for the upgrade of its intelligent voice assistant Siri, it is expected that in iOS 18, the voice assistant will show a new look.

It is understood that the future Siri will expand more functions to provide users with more help, and become a truly "intelligent" voice assistant. Users will still be able to wake it up with voice commands, but the upgraded Siri will be able to do more tedious, detailed and complex work.

The current Apple intelligent voice assistant Siri has obvious shortcomings, but if Apple can expand more functions in it, I believe Siri will eventually become a truly intelligent application.

Artificial Intelligence is an important area for future development, and Apple, as a well-known tech powerhouse, is naturally not willing to lag behind. With the increasing number of AI features in chatbot services and apps, the development of AI technology has become a priority for Apple.

To that end, Apple has increased its investment in AI and created a research and development team called Foundational Models. Although the team consists of just 16 people, it spends millions of dollars on research every day, which shows the importance Apple attaches to it.

Earlier, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman also revealed that Apple has been quietly working on an AI project called "Apple GPT" to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Gurman said that since last year, Apple has been developing "Ajax", a framework similar to the large-scale language model of ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing and Google's Bard. It is reported that Ajax is built on Google's Jax machine learning framework, running on the Google cloud.

And previous news that Apple had considered signing a contract with OpenAI, but also on OpenAI's technology for enterprise trials, but unfortunately ultimately failed to reach an agreement.

If Apple Siri can get AI support, I believe that this voice assistant will be able to quickly step into the real intelligent field, and the use of Apple's products experience will also be greatly improved.

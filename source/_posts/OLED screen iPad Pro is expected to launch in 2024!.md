## OLED screen iPad Pro is expected to launch in 2024!

Recent news suggests that Apple will launch new 11/13-inch iPad Pro models during the second half of 2024, and that this will be Apple's first iPad product with an OLED screen.

Both new models have a somewhat larger screen size than the existing 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros, likely achieved by narrowing the screen bezel, similar to the upcoming iPhone 15Pro series, which increases the screen-to-body ratio by narrowing the bezel.

A larger screen can bring a smoother using experience, and OLED technology has the advantages of being thin, light, bright, low power consumption, fast response, high clarity, good flexibility, high luminous efficiency, etc., which can bring a better display effect.

The iPad Pro released by Apple after 2017 already supports ProMotion, with a screen refresh rate between 24Hz and 120Hz, and with OLED support, this lower limit is expected to drop to 10Hz or lower, so as to achieve the effect of improving endurance.

However, OLED panels are more costly, so the new iPad Pro could be priced even higher. According to previous supply chain sources, the 11-inch iPad Pro is expected to start at $1,500 (roughly Rs. 10,450), while the 13-inch will start at $1,800 (roughly Rs. 12,500).

This is not a bad price, but the selling price is affected by a number of unstable factors, so the final price of the new iPad Pro may still change, as to whether it is adjusted downward or raise the price is not known.

Plenty of sources suggest that the new OLED-displayed iPad Pro is expected to be mass-produced in the first half of 2024, and Apple will likely release the product by the middle or second half of 2024. With the launch of the OLED-screened iPad Pro, Apple will be more competitive in the tablet market.

In addition to this, Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman also revealed in the recent past that Apple will equip the new iPad Pro with a new MyoControl keyboard. The new MyoControl keyboard will be made of aluminium for the first time, providing users with a more advanced and rugged experience.

Not only that, this MyoControl Keyboard will also come with a larger touchpad that will help users better manipulate their cursors. The two products complement each other, bringing 1+1 far greater than 2.

Mark Gurman said that the new MyoControl Keyboard is likely to carry a price tag of $299 (roughly Rs. 2,174) and is expected to launch alongside the new iPad Pro.

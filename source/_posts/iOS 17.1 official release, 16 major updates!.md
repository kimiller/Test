The official version of the update package size of 1.5G or so, the internal version number 21B74 (iPhone 15Pro for 21B80), as the version number and the previously released RC version of the same, meaning that users who have been upgraded to the RC version of the user want to upgrade to the official version of the need to protect the information to upgrade the brush, but I do not recommend, because the RC version of the official version with the updated content is the same, there is no need to to toss ~

Previously, the French regulatory agency ANFR website has reported that Apple promised to release the official version of iOS 17.1 before October 24 to fix the radiation problem of the iPhone 12, but I don't know why it was delayed until today.

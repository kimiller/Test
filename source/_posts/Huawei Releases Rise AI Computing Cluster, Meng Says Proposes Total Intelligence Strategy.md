On 20 September 2023, Huawei's Fully Connected Conference was held in Shanghai. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's vice chairman, rotating chairman and CFO, delivered a keynote speech at the conference.

Meng said that facing the era of intelligence, in order to seize the historic strategic opportunity of AI, Huawei proposed the All Intelligence strategy - the goal of the strategy is to accelerate the intelligent transformation of thousands of industries, so that all objects can be connected, all applications can be modelled, and all decisions can be computed.

"Under the guidance of the All Intelligence strategy, Huawei will continue to build a solid base of arithmetic power to enable a hundred modes and a thousand states, and empower a thousand industries."

Meng Wanzhou said, first of all, Huawei is committed to building China's solid arithmetic base, for the world to build the second choice, the future will continue to improve the "soft hard core edge end cloud" integration ability, do thick "black land", to meet the diversity of AI arithmetic needs of all walks of life. "

Secondly, Huawei will also support the "blossoming" of large models in the era of intelligence through the opening of computing power bases, AI platforms, and development tools. "We support each organisation to train its own big models using its own data, and allow each industry to develop its own industry big models using its own expertise. "

Finally, Meng said that over the past decades, Huawei has delved into the theoretical nature of communications and computing, and has continued to invest and explore in the fields of mathematics and algorithms, chemistry and materials science, physics and engineering technology, and standards and patents, to build up a rooted technological advantage. Facing the intelligent future, Huawei will continue to adhere to open hardware and open source software, and develop industrial and ecological alliances and talent alliances with industrial partners to build a prosperous computing ecosystem.

After Meng's speech, Huawei's Managing Director, Director of the ICT Infrastructure Business Management Committee, and President of the Enterprise BG, Wang Tao, released the Atlas 900 SuperCluster, a new architecture of the Rise AI compute cluster - as AI enters the era of big models, big computing power is becoming the core engine of AI As AI enters the era of big models, big computing power is becoming the core engine of AI development.

According to Wang Tao, Huawei's Atlas 900 SuperCluster, a new architecture of the Rise AI computing cluster, can support large model training with more than a trillion parameters.

Specifically, the new cluster adopts the new Huawei Star River AI Intelligent Computing Switch CloudEngine XH16800, with its high-density 800GE port capacity, the two-layer switching network can realise a 2,250-node (equivalent to 18,000 cards) ultra-large-scale non-convergent cluster network.

The new cluster also uses an innovative supernode architecture, which greatly improves large model training capabilities. In addition, it also leverages Huawei's comprehensive strengths in computing, networking, storage, energy, and other areas to comprehensively improve system reliability at the device level, node level, cluster level, and service level, and increase large model training stability from the day level to the month level.

Wang Tao said that Huawei is currently changing the traditional server stacking model, creating AI clusters with system architecture innovation, and realising the integrated design of arithmetic, transportation, and storage to break through the big arithmetic bottleneck.

Hardware enablement is the key to unleashing big computing power and the basis for big model development. According to Wang Tao, in order to accelerate the innovation of big models, Huawei also released the more open and easy-to-use CANN 7.0, which is not only fully compatible with the industry's AI frameworks, acceleration libraries, and mainstream big models, but also enables AI frameworks and acceleration libraries to more directly call and manage computing resources, enabling developers to customise high-performance arithmetic, so that the big models can have a differentiated competitiveness.

For the development of Transformer network models, Huawei has also upgraded the Ascend C programming language to simplify the logic of operator implementation in a more efficient programming manner, shortening the development cycle of convergence operators from two person-months to two person-weeks, enabling the rapid development of AI models and applications.

Wang Tao said that Huawei, based on the newly released industry intelligence reference architecture, has jointly released nine industry intelligence solutions for finance, government affairs, manufacturing, electric power, and railways, in collaboration with customers and partners. Wang Tao said that in the future, Huawei will also create more industry solutions to promote the deep integration of AI and industry scenarios.

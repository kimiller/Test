## iPhone 16 series will be equipped with A18 chip, A17Pro just transition?

According to supply chain analyst Jeff Pu, Apple's iPhone 16 series next year will be equipped with the A18 series chip, while the current iPhone 15 Pro equipped with the A17Pro chip may not appear in next year's model.

According to Jeff Pu, the chip configuration of the iPhone 16 series is as follows:
- iPhone 16: with A18 chip (using TSMC's N3E process);
- iPhone 16 Plus: powered by the A18 chip (using TSMC's N3E process);
- iPhone 16 Pro: powered by the A18 Pro chip (TSMC's N3E process);
- iPhone 16 Pro Max: powered by the A18 Pro chip (using TSMC's N3E process);

N3E refers to TSMC's second-generation 3nm chip manufacturing process, which is more affordable and has higher yields than the first-generation 3nm process, N3B, which is used for the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro model.

Considering that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are still powered by the A16 Bionic chip, the jump to the A18 chip in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will usher in a lot of performance improvements.

But it's still early days before the iPhone 16 series is released, and Jeff Pu says it's unclear whether Apple will adopt the A18 and A18 Pro designations. It's also possible that the iPhone 16 series chips will be named A17 and A18 Pro, as has been the practice in recent years.

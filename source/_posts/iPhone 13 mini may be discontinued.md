## iPhone 13 mini may be discontinued

For fruit fans who like small screens, they should also be very much looking forward to this year's iPhone 15 series to have a place for the mini. But the small screen is still too niche after all, Apple has no intention of updating the iPhone mini series, and is even ready to discontinue it~

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, after the launch of the iPhone 15 series, Apple will continue to sell the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 13 and iPhone SE at a lower price, while the iPhone 14 Pro series, iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 12 may have to face being discontinued if they The iPhone 14 Pro series, iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 12 may have to face the fate of being discontinued.

For comparison, the iPhones currently available on Apple's website include the iPhone 14 series, iPhone 13 and 13 mini, iPhone 12 and iPhone SE.

Speaking of the iPhone mini series, while the 12 mini was indeed welcomed by some small-screen phone enthusiasts when it was launched, actual sales figures show that both the iPhone 12mini and 13 mini are not selling well and are not as popular as other iPhone models.

According to a survey by market research firm CIRP, in the first quarter of 2022, the iPhone 13 mini accounted for only 3 per cent of the total iPhone 13 series sales in the US, making sales really dismal.

And Apple seems to have realised that there is limited demand for smaller phones in the market, so it axed the mini series for last year's iPhone 14 series and introduced a larger screen version, the iPhone 14 Plus, which is a far more popular model and sells more than the mini series.

Of course, Apple didn't just discontinue the 13 mini last year despite cancelling the mini series, but continued to sell it on its official website. As it stands, the iPhone 13 mini is likely to be the swansong for Apple's small-screen flagship series, the last in Apple's line of smaller phones.

According to 9to5mac's report, the U.S. region of Apple on the iPhone 13 mini inventory has been seriously insufficient, and delayed the delivery time (but I went to see the availability of the domestic Apple official website of the iPhone 13 mini, there is still in stock), all signs signs indicate that it may be discontinued by Apple in the future release event.

In the future, if users want to buy a smaller sized iPhone, they will probably only have the iPhone SE as an option, but there are also rumours that even the iPhone SE may be upgraded to a larger screen version in the future, so at least for now it seems like there won't be a small-screen flagship iPhone update for a short while~

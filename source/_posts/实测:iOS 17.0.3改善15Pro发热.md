## Tested: iOS 17.0.3 improves 15Pro heating without downclocking!

Not long ago, the iPhone 15Pro series was exposed to overheating problems, and this rumour is not nothing, a lot of users who have purchased the new machine have feedback that they have encountered this problem.

It was originally thought that the heating issue was caused by the titanium frame of the iPhone 15Pro series, but now it seems that this is not the case. Apple has stated that the heating issue that occurs with the new models in use has nothing to do with the hardware or design, and that the phenomenon may be caused by a software issue.

In order to be able to deal with the issue effectively, Apple has brought a solution to the problem. In the recent push of iOS 17.0.3, the changelog of this update mentions that this update provides important bug fixes and security updates, and addresses issues that may have caused the iPhone to run hotter than expected.

It is worth mentioning that, through this iOS 17.0.3 official update, the new machine heat can be effectively resolved, and Apple did not take the way of downclocking to reduce the temperature, sacrificing the performance of the device to alleviate the heating condition is obviously not scratch.

It is understood that after updating the iOS 17.0.3 system version, the iPhone 15ProMax score situation will even be a little higher, which also initially indicates that this update will not reduce the performance of the device, but may also be improved.

Will the cooling effect of the new system be more limited while maintaining the performance of the device? In order to find out, the media has conducted some real-world tests.

The methodology was simple: the iPhone 15Pro/Pro Max was drained and recharged, the temperature was observed, and the device was compared to one that had been upgraded to iOS 17.0.3.

The test found that the temperature of the device not upgraded to iOS 17.0.3 came to a maximum of 107.1째F (41.7째C) while charging, which is not a bad temperature, and this is almost the norm for the iPhone 15Pro series while charging.

And after upgrading to the iOS 17.0.3 system version, the iPhone 15Pro/ProMax's body temperature while charging tops out at 93.8째F (34.3째C) and doesn't fluctuate much.

So it seems that the new system does play a great role in cooling down the device and only optimises the system and apps without affecting the original performance.

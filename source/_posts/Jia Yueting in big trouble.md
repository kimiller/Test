According to the market ban decision letter issued by the 2021 SEC, it was found that LeEco, Jia Yueting and others had the following unlawful facts:

- First, LeSee.com committed financial fraud from 2007 to 2016, and there were false records in the documents related to the application for initial public offering and listing and the annual reports from 2010 to 2016 that were submitted and disclosed by LeSee.com.

The main means used by Leshi to falsify before its listing included: falsely increasing its performance by fictionalising its business through the company actually controlled by Jia Yueting and constructing a false capital cycle through the bank account controlled by Jia Yueting. Falsely increasing performance by fictionalising business with third-party companies and constructing false fund circulation through bank accounts controlled by Jia Yueting. In the real business dealings with customers, the performance was falsely increased by pretending to be a payback.

After listing in 2010, in addition to the use of its own funds cycle and collusion "to go" fictitious business income, but also through the falsification of contracts, not the actual implementation of the framework contract or unilateral confirmation of the swap contract to continue to inflate the performance.

- Second, Lesco failed to disclose connected transactions in accordance with the regulations;

- Third, Lesco failed to disclose the provision of guarantees for Lesco Holdings and other companies;

- Fourth, LeSee's failure to truthfully disclose the fulfilment of loan commitments by Jia Moufang and Jia Yueting to the listed company.

This point especially mentioned that Jia Moufang (Jia Yueting's sister) and Jia Yueting originally promised to reduce their holdings of LeEco's shares and lend the proceeds to the listed company interest-free to supplement its working capital, but in fact, both Jia Moufang and Jia Yueting have repeatedly withdrawn their loans. The SFC pointed out that Jia Yueting violated the commitment, directly instructed the relevant personnel to draw back their own and Jia Moufang's loans, and failed to exercise due diligence and responsibility, and was the directly responsible officer in charge of the illegal behaviour of LeSee's disclosure documents with false records and material omissions. Jia Yueting, as the actual controller of LeSee, instructed the relevant personnel to engage in the aforesaid unlawful acts, which constituted the unlawful acts referred to in Article 193(3) of the Securities Law.

- Fifth, the behaviour of LeSee's 2016 non-public offering of shares constituted a fraudulent offering:

On 8 August 2016 Letvision's non-public offering was listed. Letvision's non-public offering of new shares of 106,640,300 shares raised 4,799,000,000 yuan, and the period of the three-year period of financial data declared for disclosure was from 2012 to 2014 and from January to June 2015. According to the foregoing facts about the financial falsification of Leshi, Leshi did not meet the conditions for the issuance and fraudulently obtained approval for the issuance by deceptive means.

The SFC pointed out that Jia Yueting, the then chairman of the board of directors, and Yang Lijie, the chief financial officer, played the roles of organisation, planning, leadership, and implementation in promoting the abovementioned issuance matters of Leshi.com and the financial counterfeiting matters involved in the financial counterfeiting, adopted particularly bad means such as concealment and fabrication of important facts, and the amount of counterfeiting was huge, and failed to diligently perform their duties by signing the application documents for issuance submitted and disclosed, as well as guaranteeing the truthfulness of the information disclosed, Accurate and complete, the circumstances of the offence were particularly serious, and he was the supervisor directly responsible for the fraudulent issuance behaviour of Leshi.

Wu Meng, then a supervisor, and Jia Yuemin, deputy general manager, were directly involved in the relevant financial fraud, failed to exercise diligence and due diligence, signed on the issuance application documents and guaranteed that the information disclosed was true, accurate and complete, and played a larger role in the fraudulent issuance, and the circumstances of the offence were more serious.

Liu Hong, then a director, failed to exercise due diligence in signing the issuance application documents and guaranteeing that the information disclosed was true, accurate and complete, and was the other person directly responsible for the fraudulent issuance of LeSee. According to the aforesaid facts regarding the financial fraud of LeTV, Jia Yueting, as the actual controller of LeTV, instructed the relevant personnel to engage in the aforesaid matters of financial fraud, which resulted in serious false records of the financial data of the Company for the three-year period from 2012 to 2014 and January-June 2015 disclosed in the application for declaration of the non-public offering and constituted the unlawful acts referred to in the second paragraph of Article 189 of the Securities Law.

On 12 April 2021, Leshi.com announced that it had received the Decision on Administrative Penalties made by the CSRC. Due to ten years of financial falsification, failure to disclose connected transactions and other illegal facts as stipulated in the regulations, the CSRC decided to impose administrative penalties on Leshi.com, Jia Yueting, and 15 other responsible parties, including a total fine of more than 240 million yuan on Leshi.com, and a fine of more than 241 million yuan on Jia Yueting.

## To solve the iPhone 12 radiation problem, Apple has submitted a software update!

Previously, the iPhone 12 radiation overload issue was a big deal online, starting with the sudden announcement by France's Deputy Minister of Digital Economy, Barrowbone, that he would be banning the sale of Apple's iPhone 12 in the country because the phone's radiation levels exceeded those permitted by law.

However, the French minister later said that although the radiation levels exceeded the accepted standards, they were not dangerous and people could continue to use the phones.

Apple then responded by saying, "We will be releasing a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocols used by French regulators. We expect iPhone 12 to remain available in France." Apple also emphasised that "This is related to a specific testing protocol used by the French regulator and not a security issue."

And earlier today, French regulators said they had received an iPhone 12 software update from Apple, and that they were evaluating the software program to see if it would actually address the iPhone 12 radiation overload.

If the software update is able to change the electromagnetic waves emitted by the device, then the French regulators will determine that the model complies with the EU standards enforced in France and revoke the stop-sale and recall orders.

## The official version of iOS 17.0.2 is here, fixing the data migration problem!

Last Friday, Apple pushed the iOS 17.0.2 official update specifically for the iPhone 15 series models, which was thought to be exclusive to the iPhone 15, but in the early hours of this morning, Apple pushed the iOS 17.0.2 official update to other older models of iPhone.

The size of this update package is about 362M, and the internal version number is (21A351), which is not the same as the version number of the iPhone 15 series, but the update content is the same, which mainly fixes the problem that caused the problem of not being able to transfer data directly from another iPhone during setup.

Previously, according to many users feedback, on the iPhone replacement of the new iPhone 15 series after migrating data will often be stuck, reboot many times and then try to re-pair still can not be solved.

For those who encountered the problem of data migration anomaly, you can first upgrade both the old iPhone and iPhone 15 to the latest iOS 17.0.2, and then restore all the settings of the iPhone 15 and reactivate the pairing to transfer data.

For those who don't want to receive iOS update prompts, you can reply to "Shield" in our public number: Fruit Powder Home to get the description file for shielding system updates, and then you won't be prompted for iOS updates after shielding~.

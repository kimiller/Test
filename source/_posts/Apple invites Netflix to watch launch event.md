## Apple invites Netflix to watch the launch event, giving away AirPods Max headphones and snacks!

October 31, 2023 at 8:00 a.m., that is, early tomorrow morning, Apple will hold the second new conference this year. I believe that many fruit fans have not thought about this sudden move by Apple, and there are even some who have not been informed of this news.

In order to publicize the event, Apple has prepared a gift box for some netizens, which includes a pair of AirPods Max headphones and some "sweet horror" snacks and drinks for them to enjoy while watching the event.

Apple's event took place in the late afternoon, and it's thought that Apple may have chosen a different time of year than in the past to coincide with Halloween.

The gift box Apple gifted to Netflix came with an invitation, which roughly read:

"As Halloween approaches, Apple has a gift for you. On the evening of October 30th, we're going to reveal something special, and we invite you to attend this online viewing party. For a more spatial viewing experience, we want you to listen with AirPods Max, plus we've got some sweet and scary snacks."

It's worth noting that Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman said that Apple will update the AirPods Max lineup that comes with this gift box later next year, though it may just be a USB-C port replacement with a new color scheme and nothing too major.

Halloween is a traditional Western holiday, and it's usually the night before Halloween that the holiday is at its most festive, which is on the night of October 31st. Apple's new launch event is timed to coincide with this, and will probably get a lot more attention as a result.

The theme of the conference is "coming fast and furious", in which the new M3 series of chips may be the main protagonist debut, and equipped with the M3 chip iMac and MacBook Pro a series of new products will get a leap in performance improvement, become one of the focus of the conference.

We'll be able to watch Apple's launch event tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m., and this time we won't have to stay up all night. If you're interested, make sure you have some time to watch it, because you might be able to find the product of your choice.

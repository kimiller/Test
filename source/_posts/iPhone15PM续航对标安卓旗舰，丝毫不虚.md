## iPhone 15PM range against Android flagships, not in the least bit false!

In the previous tweets, our fruit powder home has shared with you that the iPhone 15 Plus has the strongest battery life performance among the iPhone 15 series, so if it is compared with the flagships of Android, how is the battery life of the iPhone 15?

Recently, TechDroider compared the battery life of the iPhone 15 Pro Max with the previous-generation iPhone 14 Pro Max, as well as the mainstream Android flagships Samsung S23 Ultra, Google Pixel 7 Pro, OnePlus 11, and Xiaomi 13 Ultra.

All models tested were set at maximum resolution and variable refresh rates to mimic a user's daily use of the phone, after 2.5 hours of Survival of the Jedi gaming + 3 hours of 4K 60fps YouTube streaming + 4 hours of Instagram browsing:

- iPhone 15 Pro Max battery remaining: 14%;
- iPhone 14 Pro Max remaining battery: 6%;
- Samsung S23 Ultra remaining battery: 16%;
- Google Pixel 7 Pro remaining battery: 0%;
- OnePlus 11 Remaining battery level: 1 per cent;
- Xiaomi Mi 13 Ultra: 10%;

As you can see, the battery life of the iPhone 15 Pro Max is still quite good, and it already belongs to the first tier among current flagships. However, the maximum charging power of the iPhone 15 series is only 27W (9V/3A), which is the bottom of the list in terms of charging speed~.

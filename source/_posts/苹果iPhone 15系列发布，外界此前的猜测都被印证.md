## Use of USB-C interface

Apple's annual fall conference is known to users as the "technology spring gala", not only will there be the most important updates, but also the launch of Apple's fist product. 13 early morning of the conference, when Cook appeared to say "iPhone and Watch updates", most users guessed that this year's launch of the iPhone and the Watch, the company's newest product will be the first time to launch the iPhone. Most of the netizens guessed that this year's conference protagonist is only these two products, and the highlights are almost the same as the previous rumors, there is no "One More Thing".

As before, this time the iPhone 15 series still has four products, including the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus for the ordinary models, the previous bangs screen upgraded to a dynamic island, which also makes years of bangs screen into the history.

Apple in the iPhone 14 Pro series for the first time in the "dynamic island", after the launch of the user favorite, this small screen interaction can bring users a more convenient experience, such as can display the process of takeout, airplane flight information and so on.

Apple was previously mandated by the EU to support the USB-C interface, this time all Apple products with a USB-C interface, which means that the same cable can now be used for iPhone, Mac, iPad and the updated AirPods Pro (second generation) charging. Users can also charge AirPods or Apple Watch directly using the iPhone's USB-C port.

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are positioned as mass-market models, so both are powered by Apple's previous-generation A16 chip, which has been Apple's usual practice. Although this is the previous generation of chips, but Apple A series chips in performance has always had the advantage.

In addition, the two machines are equipped with a 48-megapixel primary camera, the new 2x telephoto function realized through the intelligent integration of hardware and software, which provides users with three optical quality zoom including 0.5x, 1x and 2x, which is the first time that the iPhone series adopts a dual camera system.

## Pro features titanium alloy, A17 Pro chip

Apple every year to the latest technology first in the "Pro" series, before the network rumors of titanium metal frame, A17 chip, the first periscope telephoto, etc. has been verified one by one.

This year, the two Pro series appearance has not changed much, the main changes in the phone frame material and side buttons. The bezel uses titanium for the first time, previously titanium alloy material appeared in the Apple Watch Edition, titanium metal texture is better, and lightweight, which makes this year's Pro series has the narrowest screen bezel ever. In addition, the mute operation button on the left side of the phone is now a customizable feature that can be pressed to automatically turn on recording or shooting, for example.

The performance upgrades of the two new models are mainly brought by the A17 Pro chip and camera. According to reports, the A17 Pro uses a 3-nanometer chip process, which improves the entire chip in all aspects, including the largest redesign of the graphics processor, through micro-architecture and design improvements, the new central processor achieves a 10% speed increase, the neural network engine is also up to two times faster, and the graphics processor is up to 20% faster than before, with a new 6-core design to enhance the peak performance and energy efficiency. Relying on hardware-accelerated ray tracing technology, which is up to 4x faster than software-driven ray tracing technology, iPhone 15 Pro can render better graphics as well as gaming experience.

Nowadays, cell phone manufacturers are quite rolled up in the camera segment, Apple this time the Pro-class camera features a 48-megapixel primary camera, and when using the primary camera, users can switch between the three common focal lengths of 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm, or even choose one as the new default focal length.

The iPhone 15 Pro packs a 3x telephoto camera, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max offers a 5x zoom with a 120mm focal length, the longest optical zoom distance for an iPhone yet. However, some users have complained that the 5x zoom was first used a few years ago among Android-based phone makers.

One of the more forward-thinking technologies that Apple is bringing to the table this time around is "spatial video," which Apple says will be added to the iPhone 15 Pro later this year to add a new dimension to recorded video, with spatial video that meets Apple's Vision Pro standard. Users will be able to shoot in three dimensions (3D), which can be played back in Vision Pro. Apple Vision Pro launches in the U.S. early next year.

In addition, both models come with a second-generation ultra-wideband chip. When both iPhone devices have this chip, a connection can be established over a distance three times farther than before.

The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will be available in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium, and Primary Titanium finishes. iPhone 15 Pro's starting price remains unchanged at $7,999 and is available in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB of storage. iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at 9,999 yuan, offering 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage capacities, with the most expensive at 13,999 yuan, removing the multi-year 128GB starting capacity.

The new generation of Apple Watch: two-finger tap each other to take or turn off calls

Nowadays, smartwatches have become a product that many people wear every day of their lives, and this is a new product category that was first opened by Apple, but this year's watch update is much smaller than the iPhone series.

This time Apple brought Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. One of the most interesting upgrades is that when the watch receives a call it only needs two fingers to tap each other twice to connect the call, and the same gesture to hang up the call after the call is over.

Apple describes the two-finger tap as being able to control the main buttons in an app to stop a timer, play and pause music, or make an alarm remind you later. The gesture can also be used to answer or end a call, or even take a photo with the Apple Watch's remote camera. Two taps will also activate Smart Stacking in the dial, and two more taps will scroll through stacked widgets.

In addition, the new product supports users to access health data information through Siri, due to the small screen of the watch, manual operation is sometimes less convenient, Siri voice to drive to add a new way.

For requests that don't require information from the Internet, such as starting a physical workout or setting a timer, Siri will no longer rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks to give faster, more reliable responses, Apple said.

The first generation of Apple Watch Ultra was very popular as a premium product, and this time Apple has brought Apple Watch Ultra 2, which also supports the marvelous new experience of "two-finger double-tap" gestures. The second-generation Apple Watch Ultra has an upgraded chip, but it doesn't come in the previously rumored black color, and there are no changes to its appearance, making it the least upgraded new product at the launch event.

Apple Watch Series 9 starting price of 2,999 yuan; Apple Watch Ultra 2 priced at 6,499 yuan, September 13 to open ordering, September 22 on sale.

Interestingly, this year, Apple's entire conference less than 90 minutes, also recorded in advance, in addition to a large number of pages to introduce new products, and even added a "skit" to introduce the Apple Carbon Neutral. Apple's carbon neutral goals and vision for the company were presented in the Apple Watch segment, with some of the cases and bands of the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Apple Watch SE combining to be the first carbon-neutral products in Apple's history.

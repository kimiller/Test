## Some Huawei fast charging cable can't charge iPhone 15, the answer is here!

Since the launch of the iPhone 15 series, the black hot search on the Internet has not been broken, as to why, I think we understand all understand.

Especially between Huawei and Apple, once there is something, it is very easy to cause controversy, and in recent days, because of the use of Huawei's charger can not charge the iPhone 15 series of things, but also once again triggered a heated discussion among netizens.

Some users feedback that they can't use Huawei's original charging kit to charge their iPhone 15 series with USB-C port, while other brand chargers and charging cables (like Xiaomi, Samsung, OPPO, OnePlus, etc.) work fine.

To this, Huawei customer service responded that it depends on the charging specifications of the Apple device. Apple customer service, on the other hand, responded that other brands' chargers need to support the PD protocol to be able to charge the iPhone 15 series. This is because some of Huawei's chargers and charging cables don't support the PD protocol, while the iPhone 15 series phones need chargers and charging cables that support the PD protocol for fast charging.

The PD protocol is understood to be a charging protocol, a standard protocol developed by the USB-I organisation. It is a fast charging technology based on the USB port, which can achieve a maximum power output of up to 100W, and can provide a faster, more efficient and safer charging method for various devices.

The iPhone 15 series phones support the PD protocol, so you can use any charger and charging cable that supports the PD protocol to charge them. Some of Huawei's chargers and charging cables, on the other hand, use their own SCP protocol, which is incompatible with the PD protocol, so they can't charge iPhone 15 series phones.

However, not all Huawei chargers and charging cables don't support the PD protocol, as Huawei's website shows several high-speed data cables and fast-charging chargers that support the PD protocol, which are labelled on the sales page.

In addition, some netizens found that if you use Huawei's charging head with other brands of data cables, you can charge your iPhone 15 series phone. The Huawei fast charging cable with USB-A port like the one shown in the picture above does not support the PD protocol, and this one won't work, so we must pay attention to identify whether it supports the PD fast charging protocol when we buy a third-party fast charging cable.

Fast charging cable as long as support PD protocol can charge the iPhone 15, but the fast charging head must not use the high imitation cottage without the national 3C safety certification, will bring security risks.

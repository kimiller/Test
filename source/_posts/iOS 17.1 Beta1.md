## iOS 17.1 Beta1: Big AirDrop Upgrade, New Ringtones Cancelled

Following yesterday's release of the official version of iOS 17.0.2 to older models, early this morning, Apple has pushed out an update to the iOS 17.1 Beta test version for Developer Preview users. Users who have already signed up for the Apple Beta version of the software programme simply need to open the Settings - General - Software Updates to upgrade to the latest iOS 17.1 beta version online OTA.

The size of the update package is about 6.3G, the internal version number is (21B5045h), as the second major update of the iOS 17 system, iOS 17.1 first beta version still brings a lot of new features.

## AirDrop upgrade
The first is the upgrade of AirDrop, in this year's WWDC conference, Apple said that it will upgrade AirDrop (air-drop), and now not only can it be transmitted in close proximity, even if the two devices are separated by a long distance, it can also be transmitted through cellular data to maintain lossless security.

And in the iOS 17.1 Bet1 beta, Apple has already completed the upgrade to AirDrop, now even if the transferring user is not within the range of AirDrop, AirDrop transfer can be completed via cellular connection or Wi-Fi.

However, this feature is turned off by default and needs to be turned on manually by opening Settings - General - AirDrop and turning "Use cellular data on". This also means that we don't have to stay together all the time, even if we are transferring large files from our friends or other people.

## NameDrop is also here

In addition to the upgrade of AirDrop, the new feature "NameDrop" is also here, the main function of this feature is that when two Apple Watch or iPhone is close to the user can quickly pass personal business cards and other related information through NameDrop, it is simply a must-have feature for social cows!

## wallpaper can be automatically extended

After upgrading to the beta version of iOS 17.1 Beta1, users can manually turn on and off the retractable wallpaper function when setting the wallpaper, which will automatically adjust the most suitable screen size when turned on, and users do not need to manually adjust it.

## Apple Music function icon adjustment

In addition, Apple Music's page has also been fine-tuned, the original "favourite" function icon has changed from "♡" to "☆", including the lock screen interface, we can also directly tap the "☆". Including on the lock screen, we can directly tap "☆" to mark a song as a favourite.

## New ringtone cancellation

In the previous version of iOS 17, Apple added more than 20 new ringtones and alert tones, but in the iOS 17.1 beta these new ringtones have been removed, it is not yet clear what the reason is, but this love should be re-added in the subsequent Beta version.

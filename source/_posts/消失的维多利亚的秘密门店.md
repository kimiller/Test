## The rise of Generation Z consumers is reshaping the competitive landscape of China's lingerie market. 

Sexiness and aesthetics used to be one of the criteria for selecting lingerie for many women. But in recent years, Generation Z consumers, who emphasise self-pleasing and comfort, are driving new lingerie trends in China. With the rise of a number of domestic lingerie brands, the market for lingerie brands that used to focus on sexy aesthetics has been compressed.

With a huge population base, China has become the second largest lingerie market for women in the world, with a market share of more than US$17 billion, second only to the US, which has a market share of US$18 billion.

And China's lingerie market has been in a state of chaos for years. China's lingerie market is extremely fragmented, with no single brand being called a true giant. In a competition that is both fragmented and homogenised, established players are facing declining revenues and profits, while newer brands, despite attracting some Gen Z consumers, do not have the same deep roots in offline channels as the older generation of brands.

Recently, the international big brand Victoria's Secret has successively shut down its shops in first-tier cities and transformed to online channels and sinking markets, and new brands have also begun to layout offline channels. International brands and national brands, old brands and new brands, the market competition is getting hotter and hotter.

At present, it is still difficult to see which underwear brand can become the final winner. However, it is certain that the rapid integration of online and offline channels, Internet thinking and traditional thinking, will be the key to win in this long competition.

## Victoria's Secret falls out of favour

In June this year, another Victoria's Secret shop in Beijing ended its business.

The shop, located in Beijing's core Wangfujing business district, opened in November 2017 and boasted a huge shopping space on three floors with an area of about 2,700 square metres. At one time, the huge glass curtain wall was decorated with the words "VICTORIA'S SECRET", and at night, the pink lights were lit up like a dream.

This shop is not only the first Victoria's Secret shop in Beijing, but also its fourth full-category shop in China after Shanghai, Chengdu and Chongqing, as well as the fourth flagship shop in the world and the second flagship shop in China to have a Victoria's Secret Angel Suite. At the beginning of the opening of the shop, a grand premiere party was once held here.

In 2017, Victoria's Secret shops and the Victoria's Secret show were red hot in China, but now it shows the trend of defeat: before the closure of this year's Wangfujing Zhonghuan shop, Victoria's Secret closed its Xidan shop in October last year, and the Sanlitun Taikoo Li shop has also closed, and the share of Beijing's Victoria's Secret shops has shrunk with it.

The reason for Victoria's Secret's shop closures is related to declining revenues and profits.

Founded in 1977, Victoria's Secret is known as the "originator of sexy lingerie". In the 1990s, Victoria's Secret became the largest lingerie retailer in the United States, and the "Victoria's Secret Show" launched in 1995 has long led the women's underwear fashion.

In 2009, Victoria's Secret's sales reached its peak, hitting an average of 600 pieces of lingerie sold every minute, with annual sales of $10.7 billion.

However, as consumer tastes change, sexy is no longer always a fashion trend. With the popularity of egoism, women are no longer looking for sexy bodies, and Veep's sales have declined, while the Veep show's ratings have been getting lower and lower, eventually ceasing to run in 2019.

From 2016 to 2019, Veep's revenue and net profit continued to fall. in 2019, Veep's parent company, LBrands Group, had a net loss of $366 million.

According to Victoria's Secret's 2022 financial report released in March this year, for the 12 months ended 28 January, Victoria's Secret's sales were $6.344 billion, a year-on-year decline of 6.5%, and net profit of $337 million, a year-on-year decline of 48%. And in the fourth quarter of 2022, sales fell 7.1 per cent to $2.021 billion, and net profit fell 30 per cent to $172 million.

At the beginning of the entry into China, Vimy has high hopes for the Chinese market, but in recent years, Vimy has also been in the Chinese market in the loss, until the first quarter of 2023 to turn the loss into profit.

In order to reduce losses, Vimy began to adjust the business strategy in China, closed several shops in first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and is committed to expanding shops in second-tier cities, online live broadcasting, restarting the big show and other ways to regain the position in the underwear market.

## China's underwear market to open "chaos" mode

"Sniper" traditional big brand Vimy's, is no longer a number of one-sided emphasis on sexy, but focus on wearing comfortable, cost-effective domestic lingerie brands.

In the huge Chinese market, Vimy to compete with many local brands, both urban beauties, Maniform, Amour, Gujin and other old-generation brands, but also in recent years the rise of banana inside, Ubras, milk sugar pie, have a tree and other emerging brands.

Women's underwear is different from other clothing categories, it is more private, and not in the external display, consumers will not be through the purchase of a particular brand of underwear to obtain a sense of identity.

At the same time, underwear is a new product, women often wear underwear every day time to more than 12 hours, if the underwear deformation, dirty can not be washed, you need to replace in a timely manner.

When purchasing other garments, female consumers may make their decisions mainly based on brand effects, visual effects, etc. However, based on the specificity of lingerie, health, comfort, and reasonable prices are the most important factors influencing many people's purchasing decisions.

Compared with the previous generation of consumers who pursued sexiness, Generation Z has a higher pursuit of health and comfort when purchasing lingerie, and their needs are more diversified: there are consumers who pay more attention to stability, non-running, and a strong sense of support; and there are consumers who pay more attention to lightness and breathability, and a sense of no pressure.

Many consumers are not very loyal to underwear brands. Qin Li, a post-90s consumer in Beijing, told Value Planet that she has a great deal of anxiety about her sagging breasts, so she goes to offline shops to pick out underwear over and over again each time. Most of the time, she goes to small clothing shops within the second ring road, and doesn't care about the brand, but just hopes to find underwear that suits her figure.

Qin Li's friend Star is the other extreme. She hates all constricting underwear, and at one point, she didn't even wear underwear. Now, she still doesn't buy underwear with steel rings, and will only buy stretchy sports tank tops online that have no steel rings, no sizing, and are breathable. Although comfortable to wear, the price for this is a serious change in body shape, but she doesn't care, "as long as there's no bump when you go out."

In addition, with the emergence of fitness, yoga and other new consumer scenarios, non-steel ring sports underwear also appeared in the trend of "external wear". After adjusting the product, the internal and ordinary underwear has the same supportive effect, the appearance is similar to a short vest, is used for fitness wear, and yoga trousers and other products with the use of.

At first, Star wasn't used to wearing too many cool, revealing tank tops at the gym, wearing sports underwear but over loose cotton T-shirts. But after she watched more and more new outfits on social media, she gradually changed her mind. She purchased a yoga outfit for around $100 that consisted of a sports tank top, a pair of cotton yoga trousers and a light blue quick-dry tunic. With the tunic on, the overall dress code is less revealing, but it still shows off her stomach.

Star told Value Planet, "The best thing about these tank tops is that you can always see the belly fat, which makes me more motivated to work out, and they're designed to be comfortable, even though there's no brand."

As for the Vimy brand, Qin Li and the stars are not interested: their bodies are not quite in line with mainstream aesthetics, watching the Vimy show where celebrity models converge can only invariably bring them great pressure. "And Vimy price is high, underwear and then look good, only they can see, spend 200 yuan to buy a piece of underwear is not quite worth it." Star said.

As consumers are very sensitive to the size and comfort of underwear, and each consumer has different needs and ways of shopping, which leads to extreme fragmentation of the underwear market. Currently, there are more than 3,000 lingerie brands in China, yet none of them can become a giant in the true sense of the word.

Industry analysis data show that among the many brands, only Amore has a market share of more than 2%, Uniqlo and Urban Beauty have a market share of 1.8% and 1.3% respectively, while many other brands are below 1%.

The melee in the lingerie industry has been going on for many years. 2016 to 2017 saw the emergence of many new homegrown lingerie brands, while Vimy also accelerated its expansion in China with high-profile shop openings. To this day, old and new brands still have their own advantages: emerging brands are better at online marketing, while traditional brands have more advantages in offline channels.

In 2018, Ubras launched the concept of "no-size underwear", which meets the needs of different sizes through elastic fabrics, ergonomic teardrop-shaped coasters and tank top designs, and has taken advantage of the wave of new consumerism to become popular. In addition, emerging brands such as Ubras and Banana Nei have started to launch more non-marking underwear products.

Founded in 2016, now valued at 12 billion banana is through network marketing frequently "out of the circle", not only rely on explosive products to create awareness, but also frequent cross-border marketing, and SpongeBob SquarePants, too two pickled fish and other IP cooperation. 

Among them, banana once with too two pickled fish launched the "two exclusive socks", with "wear good socks seriously eat fish, so that the sour feeling from head to toe" slogan attracted many young consumers.

Traditional underwear brands have a deeper foundation in offline channels. Urban Beauty, for example, has a nationwide offline channel, with more than 4,200 shops, and is currently continuing to promote the "100 cities and 1,000 shops" plan to build a combination of online and offline sales and service network.

Old and new brands have their own advantages, and the underwear industry is a highly homogenised industry, products borrowed from each other, imitation of the situation is very common. This underwear war, is expected to be difficult to distinguish between winners and losers in the short term.

## How to win the underwear competition

For any lingerie brand, want to stand out in the increasingly competitive homogenised market, is a huge test.

However, also because the Chinese women's lingerie market is not centralised, all major brands still have a chance. Compared to Europe and the United States market head brand 20% -50% concentration, China's top five brands of women's underwear market concentration is only 6%.

At present, the general price range of a piece of women's underwear between 50 to 200 yuan, but the cost is only 30-40 yuan. The scale effect of production has greatly compressed the cost of lingerie, making it a huge profit margin. For each brand, the key is still to capture consumers by virtue of their products, synergise the development of both online and offline channels, and increase consumer repurchase rate and loyalty.

Under the impact of the new generation of lingerie brands, international brands and traditional domestic giants on the defensive have reformed and started to adjust their business strategies, focusing more on meeting the needs of Generation Z consumers, creating explosive products, and integrating online and offline channels.

In tandem with the closure of shops in China's first-tier cities, there is also its continuous exploration of localisation and sinking markets.

At first, Veep moved its European and American data and product lines to China, but the body shape of European and American women differs greatly from that of Chinese women, and Veep's design layout is not suitable. Many Chinese women therefore struggled to find the right size at Veep.

In 2022, Vermi announced a partnership with Vivienne, a lingerie brand founded in Hong Kong with extensive experience in the Chinese market, to open a joint venture company, VSCO Holdings, which is controlled by Vermi.

At the same time, Vimy began its digital exploration, opening flagship shops on multiple internet platforms and using big data to mine consumer demand and serve new product development.

In 2022, the first product after the cooperation between Veep and Vijenne, "Jelly Stripes Tank Top", became a hit. Instead of highlighting sexiness with lace like previous Veep products, it gathered new highlights such as soft support, anti-sagging, and machine-washable deformation prevention, which are favourite among women, and it sold more than one million copies after it was launched, and became a hit lingerie item. Since then, Vimy has launched products such as supermodel trousers and anti-gravity bra.

At the same time as localised product development, Vimy began to lay out light-volume shops in second- and third-tier cities such as Taiyuan and Shenyang, accelerating the laying of offline channels in sinking markets. However, many experts are not optimistic about the market prospects of Vimy in second- and third-tier cities, because the sinking market has long been held by national brands such as Urban Beauty and Amour, and it still takes time for consumers to build up awareness and goodwill towards Vimy.

At the same time, the old generation of domestic underwear brands have also made use of big data analysis and supply chain upgrading and other means to achieve the brand's own innovation and efficiency, in order to adapt to the needs of consumers in the new era.

Taking urban beauty as an example, at the end of 2021, Zheng Yaonan, the founder of urban beauty, returned to personally take charge of the "second start-up" with the goal of turning losses into profits. In an interview, Zheng Yaonan said that the digital transformation and member operation is the key direction of change in the future, urban beauty has set up a team dedicated to the study of the creation of explosive products, to launch a new product with comfortable, stylish, cost-effective, high value of the four key qualities.

In addition, urban beauty is also committed to insight into consumer demand through big data, and then feedback to the supply chain. Half a month after his return, Zheng Yaonan announced that he had entered into a strategic alliance agreement with suppliers to form a strategic alliance in the supply chain, sharing information on fashion trends, material development and product design, as well as investing in upstream companies, timing purchases, and staggered production to achieve the goals of cost reduction, efficiency and inventory reduction.

Older brands with more stable roots are starting to explore digitalisation and layout online channels, while newer brands are starting to ramp up their offline shops. Online marketing is easy to create explosive products, but due to the lack of trying on and the advice of professional guides, the return rate remains high, so offline service is particularly important.

In June 2022, Milk Sugar Pie, a brand that focuses on large-cup bras, received a billion-dollar B round of financing and began to lay out offline service outlets. The founder of Milk Candy Pie, Dabai, said in an interview that the brand's future growth opportunities and space are offline, and plans to open offline shops on a large scale, hiring professional service staff to help consumers measure one-on-one and "teach consumers how to choose."

In addition to Milk Candy Pie, brands such as Inside Out, Banana Inside, and Ubras have also laid out offline early. Inside Out tried to expand offline channels as early as 2016, with more than 100 shops, while Banana Inside opened its first experience shop in Shenzhen in 2020.

## concluding remarks

The future trend of competition in the lingerie market will inevitably be based on the integration of supply chains and sales channels, with continuous product iteration and innovation to meet the different needs of different groups.

No underwear can be suitable for all women, as women's needs become more and more diversified, the women's underwear industry can be broken down into several sub-tracks: the pursuit of fitness women need to be more suitable for sports sports corsets and wearable vests; women who have been breastfeeding and lactating women, underage women and other groups of people have become more demanding in terms of both plasticity and comfort.

To meet the diversified needs of the consumer market, companies need to continue to innovate in terms of fabrics and design, and provide consumers with more comfortable products through different online and offline sales channels.

New and old brands have their own advantages and shortcomings. For any brand, only in the play advantage at the same time as soon as possible to make up for the short board, in order to achieve 1 +1 > 2. can be the fastest speed integration of online, offline advantages, Internet thinking and industrial capacity of the brand, may be in this long and complex in the big battle to stand out.

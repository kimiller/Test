## iPhone 17 may come with Apple's own 5G chip!

iPhone's signal problem has been widely users complained, and in order to solve this short board, Apple also in the early days of the road began to self-research 5G modem ~ according to the well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's latest report, Apple plans to use its own design of 5G modem chip on the iPhone from 2025.

Once this news came out, the words # iPhone signal is too poor or will be solved # words rushed to the first position of the microblogging hot search, it can be seen that we are still very concerned about the iPhone signal problem.

As early as July this year, Guo Ming-Chi said that the fourth generation of iPhone SE will be Apple's first device equipped with a self-designed 5G modem, and delayed until 2025 to mass production.

Apple has been interested in developing its own 5G modem for more than five years and acquired most of Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019, the report said. Under the 2025 timeline, it is expected that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models will continue to use Qualcomm's modem. If the previously reported development challenges are overcome, Apple's modem switch could begin with the fourth-generation iPhone SE and iPhone 17 models.

It's not clear whether an Apple-designed 5G modem will provide a significant boost to the iPhone's signal compared to a Qualcomm modem, but it would at least reduce Apple's reliance on supplier Qualcomm and further save on iPhone manufacturing costs.

It is important to know that in 2017, the two tech giants, Apple and Qualcomm, went to court over $1 billion in royalties and engaged in a two-year patent litigation that was not resolved until 2019.

However, developing a 5G modem in-house is a challenging task as it requires a lot of R&D and testing work to ensure that it is stable in all network environments. Large chipmakers such as Qualcomm have already made great strides in this area, so the technical barriers Apple needs to overcome should not be underestimated.

Apple has successfully designed its own chips in-house in the past, such as the A-series processors and M-series coprocessors, which have made huge breakthroughs in performance and efficiency. Therefore, despite the challenges, Apple is still expected to make significant progress in the 5G modem space, bringing more innovation and competitive advantage to its future iPhones.

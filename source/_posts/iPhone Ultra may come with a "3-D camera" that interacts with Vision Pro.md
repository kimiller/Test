## iPhone Ultra may come with a "3-D camera" that interacts with Vision Pro!

This year's WWDC conference, Apple brought the new Vision Pro headset, caused the industry and consumers a wide range of attention and discussion. This is a mixed reality device that integrates VR and AR, allowing users to switch freely between the virtual and real worlds.

In order to further improve the utility of Vision Pro, Apple seems to be ready to add more features to the iPhone to enable deeper interaction with Vision Pro.

According to a report by Macrumors, a future "iPhone Ultra" model may be able to capture space photos and videos for display in Apple's Vision Pro headset.

When launching the Vision Pro, Apple mentioned that the spatial video and photos are designed with "incredible depth", allowing users to "see a moment in time". Apple said the feature was designed to allow users to relive their memories in a way never before possible.

Equipped with Apple's first three-dimensional camera, Vision Pro lets users capture, relive and immerse themselves in their favourite memories with spatial audio. Each spatial photo and video takes users back to a specific moment, such as a celebration with friends or a special family gathering. Users can access their entire photo library on iCloud and view their photos and videos in true-to-size proportions, vibrant colours and spectacular detail.

According to the latest leaks, the Vision Pro's "3-D camera" could be added to the iPhone, allowing users to add more hardware to the existing rear camera setup, which includes a main camera, telephoto camera, ultra-wide-angle camera, LiDAR scanner, and an adaptive True Tone flash. Tone flash.

Thanks to the "3-D camera", the imaging capabilities of the future iPhone Ultra may lead people to think about the camera configuration of mobile phones, "what kind of photos and videos should a mobile phone take?"".

While standard photos and videos from an iPhone or other device can still be viewed on the headset, 3D images and videos are more immersive and can only be captured using the Vision Pro itself. This feature is so important to the Vision Pro experience that there is a dedicated mechanical button on the top of the device to activate it.

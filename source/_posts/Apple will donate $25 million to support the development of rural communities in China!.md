## Apple will donate $25 million to support the development of rural communities in China!

According to Apple's official press release, Apple recently announced that it will further increase its support for helping farmers, empowering students, and revitalising communities in China through a partnership with the China Rural Development Foundation.

Apple will donate 25 million RMB to the China Rural Development Foundation (CRDF), building on Apple's collaboration with CRDF over the past decade in the area of supporting local communities in China. This additional donation will be used to help farmers learn new skills to grow their businesses and provide technology and digital educational resources to empower students and teachers in rural areas.

"We believe it's important to give back to the communities where Apple is present, both globally and in China, and we're always exploring ways we can maximise the positive impact we have on local communities." Apple CEO Tim Cook said, "We are committed to supporting education programmes and providing technical support to farmers and student groups across China because education can change the destiny of so many, creating opportunities, empowering communities and supporting the development of the next generation."

Apple's support for the China Rural Development Foundation began with relief and reconstruction after the 2013 Lushan/Ya'an earthquake. Since then, the two companies have worked together to establish the Shanpin Commune, which supports agricultural development; the Zhihui Classroom, which introduces iPads to rural schools; and the Sichuan Mengdingshan Co-operative Development Training Institute, which has provided more than 2,400 rural co-operative chairpersons with advanced skills courses, including e-commerce and quality control.

These projects are part of Apple's broader commitment to supporting communities across China and building on its 30-year history of connecting with local people. In the past year, Apple also opened the Apple SmartWell Education Centre for supply chain employees at Zhejiang University, which features leading learning labs where supplier employees can access cutting-edge courses in mechanical engineering and programming, as well as health and wellness.

As part of Apple's commitment to the environment and communities in China, Apple partnered with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to improve the management of more than 400,000 hectares of productive forests in China. And through Apple's China Supplier Clean Energy Fund, the industry's first investment fund, Apple works with its suppliers to invest in sourcing clean energy and putting projects into operation. Currently, more than 80 suppliers in China have committed to using 100 per cent renewable energy to produce Apple-related products.

## Apple releases 2 new products!

Last night, Apple released two new products through its official website directly on the shelves, one is the long-rumoured new Apple Pencil, while the other is the iPad 10 that supports eSIM in mainland China.

According to Apple's official introduction, the new Apple Pencil features a matte exterior design with a USB-C port hidden under the sliding cap, allowing customers to pair and charge the new Apple Pencil with a USB-C cable. When magnetically attached to the side of the iPad, the new Apple Pencil will go to sleep (does not support magnetic attachment charging) to save power.

In terms of functionality, the new Apple Pencil also offers the same pixel-level precision, low latency, and tilt-angle sensing as the customer-favourite Apple Pencil (1st and 2nd generation), making it ideal for tasks such as taking notes, drawing, adding annotations, and journaling.

The new Apple Pencil will go on sale at the beginning of November, priced at $649 for the domestic version.

Compatible with all iPad models with USB-C ports, including iPad (10th gen), iPad Air (4th and 5th gen), 11-inch iPad Pro (1st-4th gen), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd-6th gen), iPad mini (6th gen).

It should be noted that the new Apple Pencil, although the price seems very fragrant, some features have been neutered, such as the removal of the pressure-sensing feature. For this feature is still important for some users, those who need this feature should still choose to buy the first or second generation Apple Pencil.

The following is a comparison chart of the differences between the three Apple Pencil in terms of functionality, and I have to spit out Cook's knife is still quite accurate. Everyone can refer to it:

As for the new iPad 10 there is not much to introduce, the hardware configuration and price is the same as before, the only change is that the updated iPad (10th generation) WLAN + Cellular model will support eSIM cellular data plan in mainland China, which allows fast, smooth and secure cellular data connection without the need for a physical SIM card.

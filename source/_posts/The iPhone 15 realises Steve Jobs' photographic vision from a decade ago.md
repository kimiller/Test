The iPhone 15 realises Steve Jobs' photographic vision from a decade ago!

The iPhone 15 series not only brings hardware updates, but also leads a new revolution in imaging, with a new Portrait Mode that fulfils Steve Jobs' vision of photography more than a decade ago.

As it turns out, Steve Jobs had already conceived the concept of certain features of the iPhone camera that could capture depth data more than a decade ago. And the Portrait Mode on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro has been able to capture depth data from photos with people or pets, allowing users to adjust the focus after the shot is taken.

Apple first introduced Portrait Mode in the camera on the iPhone 7 Plus released in 2016, using a dual-camera system to capture the subject and improve the quality of the photo by artificially blurring the background.

At the time, comparisons were made to the Lytro Light Field Camera, a lipstick-shaped pocket camera capable of taking photos with focusing effects that could be edited in post.

And years before the release of the iPhone 7 Plus, Jobs met with the founder of light field camera Lytro, Jen Wu, a brilliant computer scientist with a PhD from Stanford University, whose tech demo piqued Jobs' keen interest.

According to Adam Lashinsky's book Inside Apple, Jobs listened to Wu's demonstration and immediately invited him to Apple's headquarters to discuss the project further. Wu Jen showed Jobs Lytro's technology, discussed camera and product design, and agreed to Jobs' request to outline his vision in an email, hoping that Lytro could work with Apple to achieve three important goals.

Although the iPhone was already dominating the mobile photography space at the time, the meeting set the stage for what was to come, and Lytro went on to release a light-field camera that was not widely successful in the marketplace. Apple was awarded a patent in the process for a camera system that had the ability to change focus at a later stage. A decade later, this is how the iPhone camera system works.

In this year's iPhone 15 series, Apple is once again upgrading Portrait Mode shooting so that if the camera system detects a person, cat, or dog in a photo, it will automatically capture depth data without having to use Portrait Mode.

This allows you to adjust the depth-of-field effect or edit the subject focus afterwards without having to use a separate camera mode.

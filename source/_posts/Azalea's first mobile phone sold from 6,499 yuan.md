## Li Bin has finally released the Azera mobile phone. 

This is a rare business case of a car company coming down to make a mobile phone.

Li Bin said at the NIO IN conference site on 21 September that the mobile phone is the question he has been asked most recently. Many people say that the mobile phone market is a red sea market, entrants to the front and back, why do you still want to go down?

He said that in the past, manufacturers who wanted to do both mobile phones and cars, "the end is not good".

## Why do mobile phones?

Li Bin said, not because mobile phone companies are building cars; not because the car does not make money, to rely on mobile phone profits; after repeated consideration, he believes that the need for a seamless link with the Azera car products.

Of course, to build a mobile phone must be a flagship mobile phone. He said that the Azera mobile phone can not be said to be far ahead of the high-end mobile phone configuration they have, is a car-centred mobile phone, "a mobile phone in the style of Azera".

He said that the skyline is the unique design of the Azera mobile phone, and at the same time, you can directly access 30 functions related to car control with a single button.

Li Bin asked the team to have zero system adverts, zero commercial pre-installation, and to make no money from adverts. He half-joked that there weren't many sales to begin with, and he couldn't make much money on adverts.

Finally, Li Bin announced the price of the Azera mobile phone: 6499 yuan for the performance version, 6899 yuan for the flagship version, and 7499 yuan for the EPedition. The phone opens for shipping on 28 September.

At the same time, Li Bin said that this is their first mobile phone, so the stock is not too much, please understand, the delivery time will be informed to users in advance.

Li Bin said this is a smartphone product located in the flagship level, focusing on the ecological interconnection of mobile phones and cars, which is equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Gen2 processor, starting price of 6,499 yuan, azalea owners to support 10,000 points to pay for redemption.

The Azera NIO Phone features a two-part, same-colour body design, which is officially called the Skyline design, with nano-microcrystalline ceramics on the top part and glass or vegan leather underneath.

The body comes in seven colourways, including four in glass - Star Green, Star Grey, Stratosphere Blue and Mirror Pink - with a thickness of 8.9mm and a weight of 212 grams; and in vegan leather - Faraway Mountain Daisy, Snowy Velvet White and EPedition (Custom Edition) - with a thickness of 9.07mm and a weight of 216 grams.

In terms of core configuration, this phone is equipped with Snapdragon 8 Gen2 leading version of the processor, the core frequency of 3.36GHz, the same as the current mainstream Android flagships, up to 16 + 1TB of RAM.6.81 inches of 2K resolution screen, Samsung E6 material, support 120Hz LTPO dynamic refresh rate. Battery capacity 5200mAh, support 66W wired fast charging and 50W wireless fast charging.

For the lens section, the NIO Phone has a triple-lens module that includes a 50-megapixel primary camera with an IMX707 sensor, 1/1.28-inch sensing area, and 23mm equivalent focal length; a 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with an IMX 766 sensor; and a 50-megapixel periscope telephoto camera with an IMX890 sensor that supports 2.8X equivalent Optical zoom.

Of course, a smartphone launched by an automaker, mobile phone and car connectivity features must be the main focus of this product. On this NIO Phone, Azera brings three more important features.

Firstly, the NIO Phone can achieve full access to the control of the smart car, including the remote control key with the help of UWB, because of the low power consumption of UWB, even if the phone is not powered, UWB can still work in the background to unlock the car.

Secondly, the mobile phone itself has an independent exclusive car control button, after pressing it, it will enter an exclusive car control interface, under this interface, it can realise remote car control (find the vehicle status, parking position, leave the car window, air conditioning adjustment), in-vehicle car control (adjust the seat and air conditioning) and so on.

The interconnection between the car and mobile phones is achieved through the NIO Link created by Azera. This includes the ability to copy text and location information from mobile phones and transfer it to the car with a single click; the ability to transfer navigation to the car with a single click; and the ability to stream the camera and online meetings in real time, among other things. In addition, Azera has also brought the voice assistant NOMI in the car to the mobile phone, with the same technology, through the mobile phone version of NOMI can achieve remote vehicle control.

In addition, after the mobile phone access to the car, the car will open an independent mobile phone interface, you can completely control the mobile phone interface through the car.

Previously, Li Bin has said that more than 60% of Azera car owners are Apple's iPhone users, but the Apple iOS system has a closed problem, thus implying that it impedes the synergy and integration of mobile devices and Azera cars, "Apple is now very closed to the automotive industry, for example, Azera's second-generation platform of the car is standard with the UWB (digital key), Apple does not open the interface, messing up us very passive."

Public information shows that Azure was established in August 2022 as a mobile technology company with a registered capital of $10 million, and the legal representative is Azure co-founder Qin Lihong. At the same time, Azalea has "poached" a large number of OPPO, Huawei, Xiaomi and other mobile phone manufacturers.

For the Azure NIO Phone sales, Li Bin previously also said that only for the owners to build, will not take it as the main business, and will not compete directly with Huawei, Xiaomi and other manufacturers, "Azure mobile phone can be sold hundreds of thousands of units, half of the users to buy it will be very happy. "

Car companies to build mobile phones is not a new topic, as a new energy car giant Tesla, previously also been repeatedly rumoured to build mobile phone news, but were denied, Musk in the acquisition of twitter and faced with the problem of "Apple tax" has also mentioned, "If there is no other choice (Apple, Google), the company will not be able to make a mobile phone. If there is no other choice (Apple, Google, forcibly take down twitter), I will make an alternative alternative mobile phone."

Now, Azalea took the first step, who will become the second mobile phone "new car"?

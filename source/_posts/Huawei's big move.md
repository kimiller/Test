Huawei is restarting its strategic deployment in the high-end market in a bid to "get back" the market share of high-end mobile phones that Apple has stolen in the past three years.

Without warning, Huawei has launched the Mate60 series in the past month, as well as the Mate X5 folding screen, which is now fetching a premium of up to 6,500 yuan on second-hand platforms. What else can Huawei release? This question became the topic of much external attention at Huawei's autumn full-scene new product conference on 25 September.

Huawei executive director and terminal BG CEO Yu Chengdong said in his opening remarks that the Huawei Mate60 series has been widely loved by consumers since the opening of the Pioneer programme, and is currently working overtime in emergency production. "Huawei released Hongmeng 4.0 more than a month ago, and in just over a month's time, it has grown to more than 60 million users, with 1.2 million users added every day." Yu Chengdong said.

On the same day, Huawei released 13.2-inch MatePad Pro, M-Pencil (third generation) and a series of products, and launched a new ultra-high-end brand "extraordinary master". In the most concerned mobile phone product line, Huawei also launched the Mate 60 RS extraordinary master edition, priced from 11,999 yuan, 28 September officially on sale.

## Comprehensive sprint to the ultra-high-end mobile phone market

Right now the global smartphone market is still running at a low level, and the competition between major mobile phone brands in the stock market is still stalemate, and the return of Huawei's mobile phones is also bringing more variables to this market.
But from Huawei's current layout rhythm, mobile phone product deployment rhythm is still around the high-end products to start, and this market is also in the past "feed" Apple's biggest support of the Chinese market.

In the 25th conference site, although did not disclose too much information about the parameters of mobile phone products, but from the content of Yu Chengdong's speech on the scene, "extraordinary master" brand products will be the next few years in the ultra-high-end market, the key to victory, but also Huawei in the "Porsche Design" after the "Porsche Design" in the ultra-high-end market. "After the Porsche Design, an important step in the deployment of ultra-high-end strategy.

"Huawei after years of precipitation, today we launched a new ultra-high-end brand ULTIMATE DESIGN extraordinary master, from Porsche Design to ULTIMATE DESIGN, the brand is fully upgraded." Yu Chengdong said.

It is understood that Huawei Mate60 RS Extraordinary Master is the first mobile phone product launched by ULTIMATE DESIGN, and Huawei has used its top resources on the brand this time. According to the PPT at the scene, the mobile phone product chooses ceramic and metal as the back cover material, and achieves the first mass production and commercialisation of red ceramic in the mobile phone industry. "Red ceramics are rare ceramics, the whole body red is difficult to make, Huawei in the red ceramic sintering process for the first time added cerium dioxide rare earth elements, after more than 50 production processes to achieve." Huawei insiders told reporters.

In terms of satellite communication technology, which is of concern to the outside world, the ultra-high-end product line is also equipped with a gain rhinoceros antenna, a technology that can achieve satellite calls from 36,000 kilometres away. In addition, the product also adopts the iso-depth quad-curved screen technology, Xuanwu toughened Kunlun glass and so on.

In the view of analysts, the first product under the Extraordinary Masters brand, Huawei Mate60 RS, stacked with the previously released Mate60 series as well as the Mate X5 folding screen, will be the cornerstone of Huawei's efforts to rebuild the moat of high-end products.


"For Huawei, this year is an important point to return to the high-end market." IDC said that from the perspective of Huawei's layout, on the one hand, it is the upgrading and iteration of product power, namely the newly launched Mate60 Pro, Mate60 Pro+, and folding screen Mate X5. on the other hand, it is brand power. Brand power is divided into awareness, loyalty and reputation, and in a way, brand power is no less difficult than product degree. The addition of this new ultra-high-end brand series will increase the brand loyalty of the domestic business crowd to Huawei.

Counterpoint senior analyst Ivan Lam told reporters, "Recently, Huawei's Mate 60 series sales have grown significantly, showing the potential demand for Huawei's flagship mobile phones. Initial weekly sales almost tripled to 225,000 units, according to Counterpoint's weekly smartphone sales tracking data. Since the end of 2022, Huawei has managed to regain market share in China, becoming the sixth largest brand with more than 10 per cent market share in the country. We expect the brand's market share in China to grow further in 2024 due to its high brand exposure among China's high-income group."

## High-end market may be "changing days"

Over the past three years, "Huawei falls, Apple eats" has become a catchphrase in the industry. Clustered around Huawei terminal boss Yu Chengdong dealers from the past mobile phone provincial agents, national agents into today's car dealers, Apple has also become the biggest winner to take over Huawei's high-end market for China's mobile phones.

Ivan Lam told reporters that with the development of the mobile phone market, the current high-end has become a new trend. China's smartphone market wholesale price between 250- 399 U.S. dollars in the high-end mobile phones, in the first quarter of 2022 year-on-year growth of nearly 10 per cent, accounting for 25.5 per cent of total sales, compared with two years ago, 16.9 per cent had a significant increase. And in 2021, the market share of Android phones in the domestic high-end handset market (wholesale price above $600) shrank to 36.5 per cent from 44.6 per cent in 2020, while the iPhone stretched its lead to 27 percentage points.

But with Huawei's full return to the high-end product line, it will have a huge impact on the industry in the eyes of analysts. "On the one hand, in terms of market share, a portion of the high-end market occupied by Apple will return to Huawei, and on the other hand, in terms of technology, as Huawei devolves more technology into the supply chain, it will also bring new opportunities for the domestic industry chain." Ivan Lam said.

For example, the Spirit Communication on the Mate X5, which automatically selects the antenna through AI algorithms, and the self-developed Xuanwu tempered Kunlun glass outer screen, has seen a huge improvement in terms of drop resistance and resistance to falls compared to traditional processes. With the full relaunch of Huawei's high-end product line, these technological capabilities are coming out of Huawei's tech labs and fermenting through the supply chain's production, thus feeding back into the industry.

Counterpoint said that in the field of folding screen mobile phones, domestic suppliers such as Amphenol, Precision Research Technology, AVC and Cosun Technology have come to the fore. Combined with the advanced technology of Chinese smartphone manufacturers in manufacturing complex terminal products, from the technical point of view has already achieved a certain advantage in the development of the global folding screen industry.

And in the industry's view, practitioners are full of worries at a time when people no longer expect technological breakthroughs in the industry. The head of a domestic mobile phone manufacturer told reporters, "The industry needs a strong opponent, and Huawei's return is exciting. Recently, the outside world's attention is almost all placed in the middle of the mobile phone industry, which is something that has not happened in many years."

IDC believes that as domestic Android manufacturers continue to invest in the high-end route, it will significantly improve the competitiveness of Android phones in the high-end market. In addition, more and more Android vendors and supply chain companies, from the technology pre-research stage that is the beginning of in-depth cooperation, part of the underlying technology is also more open, more and more customised and differentiated products are emerging. "Through the accumulation of more time, from quantitative change to qualitative change, Android mobile phones are expected to gradually stand firm in the high-end market, and in the future will launch a further impact on Apple's dominant position, and the competition in the high-end mobile phone market will be more intense."

"The market with a price of more than $800 is dominated by Apple, so it's not easy to compete with Apple's iPhone, which is based on 3nm technology and a huge ecosystem. As Huawei sets its sights on the high-end flagship market, it will also need to innovate to stand out from the competition." Ivan Lam said.

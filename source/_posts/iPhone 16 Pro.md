## iPhone 16 Pro series will come standard with a periscope head Same quad-prism structure


The iPhone 15 series has been on sale for a few days, and this year Apple has stocked up very well, and many people got the new machine a week in advance.

From the current multi-party testing and feedback, the iPhone 15 Pro Max exclusive periscope telephoto performance is fair, and in the case of sufficient light during the day, it is not different from top Android imaging flagships such as Huawei and Xiaomi.

However, this exclusive configuration has forced a lot of people to all opt for the larger-screen iPhone 15 Pro Max.

But this has left a lot of people who prefer a smaller screen, but also like to take photos, very torn, do not know exactly how to choose.

This group of users can actually wait until next year, when, according to Ming-Chi Kuo's latest news, Apple will include a periscope telephoto lens as standard on next year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.

Both will come with the exact same quad-reflective prism lens as the iPhone 15 Pro Max, capable of capturing 5x optical zoom images.

The design of this quad-prism is very different from Android, as the CMOS is still flatly placed on the motherboard after going through four refractions, which can greatly reduce the thickness of the camera module, so the iPhone doesn't have a huge bulge like Android flagships.

But there are good and bad things about this design, the normal Android periscope only requires one refraction, so there is less light loss.

Apple's solution, on the other hand, goes through four refractions, and even with the best materials, it's inevitable that light will be lost along the way, which results in less incoming light eventually being conducted to the CMOS, adding to the already small bottom.

As a result, the iPhone 15 Pro Max's night telephoto performance in all of its tests so far has been very crotch-pulling, and nowhere near as good as the Android competition.



While some may see this as a lack of smearing and a focus on reproduction, there is simply too much noise and the image is too blurry, making it a substandard night shot for the vast majority of average users who use it to record their images.

Many ordinary users need does not need to restore exactly how accurate, but a good look and feel of the photo, recorded to the moment of the landscape and ta.

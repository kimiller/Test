## News that Apple plans to support manufacturing in India, the target output value will reach $40 billion!

With the domestic supply chain system relocated out of the country, the production end of India seems to have signs of rise, the country with a huge labour market, gradually gain more and more attention from enterprises, even Apple also regarded it as an important strategic place for development.

This year's iPhone 15 has already gone on sale, and India accounts for about 7 per cent of the new models, and may also be partially launched in the Chinese market. Many domestic consumers are therefore very resistant, worried that the quality of the new phone purchased is difficult to be guaranteed.

This resistance is not groundless, although the Indian production side of the access to resources has long been different from the past, but the same as the supply chain, the quality of technical staff, site facilities, resources, environment and other aspects of the gap still exists, so you can't blame consumers for not wanting to pay the bill.

However, according to the current progress, it seems that more and more Apple products will be produced in India, as mentioned earlier, the country has become an important strategic location on the way to Apple's development, and there will only be more and more Apple products made in India in the future.

According to Indian government officials, Apple plans to significantly increase production in India in the next five years, at least five times more than the current production, the goal is to reach 40 billion U.S. dollars, while in Apple's last fiscal year, India's output value has been more than 7 billion U.S. dollars.

That is to say, the future market will be a large number of Apple products made in India, and not only limited to the iPhone product line. India has already fulfilled some of the orders for the iPhone 15 series this year, and AirPods will be one of the products it produces next year.

However, the Indian official said that Apple has no plans to manufacture other products such as iPads or MacBooks in the country for the time being, and that the priority at the moment is to ramp up existing production levels. Taking this opportunity, India hopes to expand its electronics industry to $300bn by 2026.

Now that the first orders for the iPhone 15 series have been delivered, India's share of production isn't huge, but the number of orders is likely to continue to rise in subsequent years. By the time the iPhone 16 series comes out in 2024, the percentage of Indian manufacturing may increase significantly.

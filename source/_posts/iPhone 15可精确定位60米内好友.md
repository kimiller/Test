## iPhone 15 can pinpoint friends within 60 metres!

Many of our friends may not know that this year's iPhone 15 series not only brings upgrades to the processor, screen, camera, USB-C interface, etc., but also introduces a new second-generation ultra-wideband chip inside the fuselage.

At the autumn launch event, Apple has briefly introduced this upgrade, iPhone 15 users can use the "Find" app in the new function, easy to find nearby friends who also use the iPhone 15, and through the precise location interface real-time display distance and direction instructions.

According to Apple, the second-generation ultra-wideband chip has three times the range of the U1 chip. Compared to the previous U1 chip applied to iPhone 14 series and previous models and AirTags, its communication range has been significantly improved, enabling it to communicate with other devices equipped with the same chip over longer distances.

My first thought when I saw this feature at the time was: isn't this similar to WeChat's 'share real-time location' feature?

After the iPhone 15 series was launched, a blogger tested this new feature by connecting the iPhone 15 with another iPhone 15 that was about 60 metres away from his own, a distance that far exceeded the precise positioning range of the AirTags that we had seen before, and the distance was indeed three times more than that of its predecessor.

Tekn√≥filo says that this is probably the result of testing under optimal conditions, as the test was conducted outdoors in an open area; if indoors, the communication range would be limited due to interference from walls and other obstacles.

To experience the new feature, it's as simple as selecting a friend in the Find app, and when a pinpoint location is available, a "Find Nearby" button is displayed on the details card. The distance and direction arrows will continue to update as the user approaches the friend's location.

Compared to WeChat's Share Location, the iPhone 15's Find Nearby button is more precise and can display the distance in real time, but the range is not wide enough, so it can only be used in a small number of outdoor scenarios. WeChat's "Shared Location", on the other hand, although not accurate to a few metres, can also display friends' location information in real time, making it convenient for more scenarios.

However, it can be expected that on the next generation of ultra-wideband chips, it should be possible to achieve a more distant and accurate search, further improving the user experience of finding friends/items.

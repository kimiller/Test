## iPhone 15 fast charging with 20W and 30W speed difference? The actual test results came ~

From the autumn of 2020, the iPhone 12 series, Apple has cancelled the charging head that comes standard in the iPhone box in the name of environmental protection, and only retains the gift of a data line, so for the purchase of the new iPhone users, you have to pay out of your own pocket to buy a charging head, then, the purchase of the new iPhone users should buy how many W fast charging is the most cost-effective?

According to Apple's official website, the iPhone 15 Pro charging speed is the same as its predecessor, supporting 20W fast charging, about 30 minutes to charge the device to 50% power, but according to the netizen's real test, the iPhone 15 series can still support up to 27W fast charging.

So how much difference is there between the charging speeds of 20W and 27W? A blogger on Oil Tube tested the iPhone 15 Pro Max charging speed for different power (5W, 12W, 20W, 30W) chargers.

The test results show that the 5W charging time is 5 hours and 44 minutes; 12W charging time is 4 hours and 04 minutes; 20W charging time is 2 hours and 21 minutes; and 30W charging time is 2 hours and 11 minutes.

That said, the difference in charging speed between the 20W and 27W is only about 10 minutes. Moreover, in the charging speed test, these two chargers did not show more than 4 per cent difference in power during the charging process.

As per another blogger is that the USB-C port on the iPhone 15 series, while technically capable of receiving up to 27W of charging power, in reality, there is a diminishing effect in charging speed after about 20W."

For those looking for charging speed, a 30W charging head is certainly faster! But probably not if you're looking for value for money. Because Apple's official website shows that the price of the original 30W charging head ($249) is $100 more expensive than the price of the 20W charging head ($149), and considering that the difference in charging speed between the two is only 10 minutes, it would seem that the 20W charging would be a bit more cost-effective.

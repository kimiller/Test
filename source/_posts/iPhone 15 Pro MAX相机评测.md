When the iPhone 12 Pro series was first announced, I mentioned in my 12 Pro camera review that "(the iPhone 12 Pro and) ProRAW means Apple phones have officially entered the era of computational photography". On the plus side, this meant that Apple finally realised the huge gap between the iPhone and Android flagship phones in the camera space, but on the downside, the strong push for computational photography seemed to imply that Apple was planning to solve the hardware problem with software design.

Good thing Apple finally woke up in time, in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, 14 Pro Max two generations of mobile phones one after another, mobile phone camera hardware configuration, barely for the iPhone's camera to find some points. But in the face of "Lei" raging Android camp, the iPhone's response seems to be half a beat slower, and can not even get a really good telephoto camera.

However, in this year's iPhone 15 Pro Max, Apple has finally made up for the iPhone's biggest shortcoming in the field of mobile photography - the iPhone 15 Pro Max for the first time equipped with a 120mm equivalent 5 × optical zoom camera. The main camera performance has also been specifically optimised.

So the question is, will this telephoto lens allow the iPhone to keep up with the Android brigade in the photography field?


## "Seven lenses"? Don't overthink it.

In fact, if you only look at the parameters, Apple is actually very confident in the iPhone 15 Pro Max camera performance, and even said directly on the website that the iPhone 15 Pro camera is comparable to carrying seven professional lenses - this is the time to show the "fruity maths". Maths" time, because the "seven lenses" are 0.5 × macro (ultra-wide angle), 13mm ultra-wide angle (ultra-wide angle), 24mm wide-angle (main camera), 28mm wide-angle (main camera), 35mm wide-angle (main camera), 48mm telephoto (main camera) and 120mm telephoto (main camera). camera) and 120mm telephoto (periscope camera).

In terms of hardware, the iPhone 15 Pro still packs three cameras, including wide-angle, ultra-wide-angle and telephoto. The 48-megapixel main camera is set to 24-megapixel mode by default, which means that it outputs in 2-in-1 form, and it also supports users to freely switch between the three mainstream focal lengths (24mm, 28mm, and 35mm), or even choose one of them as the default focal length.

Architecturally, the telephoto camera on the iPhone 15 Pro Max features a quad-reflective prism design that combines both optical image stabilisation technology and an autofocus 3D sensor shift module. Judging from the launch photos, the autofocus 3D sensor shift module on the iPhone 15 Pro Max supports three-axis micro-motion, whereas on previous models that support periscope telephoto, it's still more likely to support a two-axis micro-motion sensor shift module.

In addition, according to Apple, with the A17 Pro chip and computational photography, this main camera can retain more dark details and take photos with sharper details and brighter colours at night or in other dark-light scenes. And with the support of the LIDAR scanner, it also enables portrait photography in night mode.

## Daytime performance: wide-angle main camera is poor, telephoto disappoints

Judging from the 15 Pro Max's performance in daytime, Apple really wasn't wrong: the A17 Pro-enabled 15 Pro Max does have a wealth of dark detail. The shadows of the building veneers are overly coordinated, and the backlit surfaces are not noticeably grainy, making for a very clean image.

The air quality in Guangzhou isn't too good these days, and the distant view of the Canton Tower looks a bit blurry. However, both the surface structure of the tower and the reflection in the water have good clarity under the 15 Pro Max's sharpening operation. The exposure orientation of the clouds is noticeably bright, failing to capture the texture of sunlight penetrating the clouds. But this treatment also does a good job of suppressing the white halos that are common at the edges of buildings in large-light-ratio HDR photos, which is a blessing in disguise.

The flowers in the foreground are a little dull, but they're actually in line with the current backlighting, but even with the in-camera distortion control turned on, there's still noticeable distortion and loss of quality in the corners of the image, so there's still room for improvement on the next-generation iPhones.

If the performance of the wide-angle and main camera is poor, the 15 Pro Max telephoto performance has to be discussed in different situations. The new 5× telephoto of the 15 Pro Max looks good at first glance when there's sufficient light, but if you zoom in to see it, the detailing of buildings in the distance actually shows obvious signs of post-processing. Despite the camera's best efforts to add detail through sharpening, the 15 Pro Max's telephoto also has a more pronounced smeared feel to it given the limitations of its optical resolution.

On the plus side, the smearing is more than just "oil painting" - after all, the smearing is quite regular, like a fine microblast print - but essentially, the 15 Pro Max's telephoto performance doesn't quite live up to the ambition of "seven lenses".

When the telephoto meets the backlight, the 15 Pro Max performance will be as green as you think. The 15 Pro Max will try to smooth out the traces of sharpening as much as possible through the algorithm, and although the details of the image can be retained, the colours will look a bit off.

## Night performance: ghosting is obvious, but the "clean" image is the highlight.

Let's take a look at the nighttime performance of the 15 Pro Max, but before we do that, there's one thing we need to make clear: the iPhone 15 Pro series still has significant ghosting issues.

![image.png](https://s2.loli.net/2023/09/24/tgenGBjaZxlYkOp.png)

Also, the oversharpening of the image is much more noticeable. Take this photo taken with the iPhone 15 Pro 3× camera with Night Scene mode as an example, the sharpened + smoothed ground has lost its original texture and instead looks like a mosaic-patterned carpet, not too dissimilar to the floor of a stone-bricked security island.

![image.png](https://s2.loli.net/2023/09/24/gt4xqMPY6LWGZ7o.png)

Noise control in the bright areas of the image is very good, however, and all the areas directly illuminated by the yellow streetlights are very clean. However, the highlights still suffer from Apple's Night Scene "grandfathered" stack overflow problem.

The same is true of the next Long Exposure, which was taken with the iPhone 15 Pro Max's main camera in Night Mode: the backbone of the building's surface is handled very well, and the tops of the intricate columns and even the sign on the building's roof are clearly recognisable.

But in addition to the clichéd light spillage problem, the part of the road where the headlights are tracked also shows the classic post-stacking error.

The good news is that if we don't shoot "long exposures", the iPhone 15 Pro Max performs very well even in handheld night scenes. Not only is the asphalt clear, but the anti-shake and dark detail are also excellent.

In addition to wide-angle, the 15 Pro Max's telephoto night scene performance is also impressive, whether it is the stone tiles near the clock tower, or the roof of the protective netting, the 15 Pro Max's detail retention is spot on, and the image is very clean.

![image.png](https://s2.loli.net/2023/09/24/YVcQZBdqrOTtaNP.png)

If you're unlucky, though, the 15 Pro Max's telephoto night shots can have other problems: images of buildings and skies just have extremely unnatural shadows, and the photos look like newspaper clippings.

Also, since the 15 Pro Max doesn't have an option to manually control the focus distance, failing to close the focus or running out of focus can happen when using the 15 Pro Max's telephoto for night shots.

![image.png](https://s2.loli.net/2023/09/24/a3HQOj6obFDV8WZ.png)

The good thing is that the combination of ultra wide angle plus night mode can bring clean artificial sky background to the 15 Pro Max, and it's not impossible to take starry sky shots with the 15 Pro Max in a field with better air and less light pollution.

## Big step forward, big step back

I don't know if you've noticed that I've been stressing keywords like "sharpening", "artificial", and "AI". This is because after experiencing the photo performance of the 15 Pro Max, I think every photo has a strong taste of computational photography, or AI optimisation. If this AI capability is used well, it can certainly take the iPhone's camera to the next level.

But what if it's not used well?

In order to verify my conjecture, after completing the original sample shots, Ray decided to use the most realistic studio shots to restore the true performance of the iPhone 15 Pro Max camera.

First of all, compared with Android phones, the 15 Pro Max's camera does have one advantage: the 15 Pro Max's colour consistency management across different cameras does a really good job, whether it's a wall, metal reflections, paper colours or the middle grey of the SpyderCube, the colours rendered across different cameras are all highly consistent. After experiencing a range of Android mobile imaging flagships, I must admit that this is something the iPhone 15 Pro Max does better.

However, if we zoom in on the details of the text in the telephoto image taken by the 15 Pro Max, the shortcomings of the 15 Pro Max are immediately exposed:

Regardless of whether there's enough light or not, the 15 Pro Max's telephoto has an extremely noticeable "pixel-guessing" phenomenon. Although this phenomenon can also occur in telephoto photos on Android phones, the "pixel guessing" algorithm on Android phones has become very mature after years of technology accumulation. However, the 15 Pro Max's performance is very poor.

That's not all, however, as Lei took the same photo with his 14 Pro's 5× digital zoom at the same lighting settings. Despite the same pixel-guessing, the 14 Pro produced text that was at least readable, and the date section was more "restrained". The 15 Pro Max, however, not only produces unreadable text, but even solid coloured bold fonts show unusual pixel sticking.

At least in this comparison, I'd say the iPhone 15 Pro Max's camera performance is not even as good as the iPhone 14 Pro.

In my review of the iPhone 14 Pro's camera, I said, "This is the most professional "dumb camera": users don't need to set up complicated settings, just unlock it, take the shot, and a nice photo will appear. Unfortunately, that comment didn't apply to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Yes, with Apple's optimisation, the iPhone 15 Pro Max can take a decent photo most of the time, but rather than AI identifying the scene for you and adjusting the reference, it's more likely that you feed the iPhone material with your photos, and the iPhone draws such a photo with your material.

There's no denying that the insistence on sensitive data not leaving the phone has put Apple significantly behind Android brands in AI development. And the camera issues that the iPhone 15 Pro Max is currently experiencing have actually been the same in Android phones over the past few years. In other words, as long as Apple continues to improve its algorithms, the camera performance of the iPhone 16 Pro Max and 17 Pro Max will definitely get better and better.

## But the problem is that the market doesn't stop waiting for Apple's progress.

For years, iPhone has been sold on its excellent hardware and operating system stability, but in the face of the ever-changing Android camp, iPhone is gradually losing its edge in the field of photography. User demand for taking more professional and creative photos and videos continues to grow, and the iPhone's limitations in this regard are becoming more and more apparent.

By Apple's standards, the iPhone 15 Pro Max does a pretty good job. But if we take the progress of Android phones' image performance as a reference, the iPhone 15 Pro's camera performance seems to be stuck in the era of the iPhone 11 Pro, which "turned the industry upside down".

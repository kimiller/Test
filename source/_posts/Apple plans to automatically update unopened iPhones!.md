## Apple plans to automatically update unopened iPhones!

Apple is reportedly planning to introduce a new initiative to enable unopened iPhones to install and run the latest version of iOS.

This new initiative is being introduced to address a common problem: although newly purchased iPhone 15s come with iOS 17 built-in from the factory, iOS 17.0.1 or later may have already been released at the time of the user's purchase, which would require the user to perform a software update after opening the box of the new iPhone, which in turn would take a certain amount of time.

Mark Gurman revealed that Apple has developed a specialised device in the shape of a mat, which can be placed in Apple retail shops. An unopened iPhone can be placed on this mat and then automatically update the system via a wireless connection.

This means that users don't need to manually set it up themselves or wait for software to download and install. This system will wake up the iPhone, install the latest version of iOS and then switch it off so that the user can enjoy the features and performance of the latest system as soon as it is unpacked for use.

The report mentions that Apple plans to roll out this system to its shops by the end of this year to make it easier for users to start using their new devices. It is important to note that the current report only mentions iPhones, but it cannot be ruled out that Apple will roll out this system to its other products in the future to provide an even better user experience.

For those who want to update their systems, this new initiative does help users to be able to get the latest operating system up and running the first time they buy an Apple device without having to wait for the tedious update process. But for those who don't like the idea of updating their system, it may be a bit of a "red herring".

Many users believe that updating iOS is a "double-edged sword", although updating to the latest system has more features and is more secure, these new features will also increase the power consumption of the iPhone, especially for some older models, which will further lead to iPhone battery life decline.

Of course, if you don't want your iPhone to be updated to the latest iOS system, you can also reply to "Shield" in our public number: Fruit Powder Home to get the description file for shielding iOS system updates, and then install it according to the prompts to shield iOS system updates.

## Apple may have a new product release this week!

Recently, several reports have indicated that Apple is planning to release new models of the updated iPad Air, iPad mini and entry-level iPad this week. However, Japanese blog Mac Otakara has suggested that instead of releasing a new iPad, Apple is more likely to release a third-generation Apple Pencil.

According to Mac Otakara, they believe that Apple will release the Apple Pencil 3 instead of a newer version of the iPad, and that the new Apple Pencil will come with a replaceable magnetic tip.

Last month, leaker "Majin Bu" revealed that the new Apple Pencil will offer interchangeable magnetic tips to support features like drawing, technical drawing, and digital painting. Some developers have also discovered that the Apple Pencil will support USB-C ports in the iOS 17.1 beta code.

As a comparison, the second-generation Apple Pencil, which is currently available on Apple's website, was released on 30 October 2018, and it comes with a non-magnetic nib and a spare nib. The second-generation Apple Pencil can magnetically attach to iPad Pro models released in 2018 and later, iPad Air models released in 2020 and later, and the latest iPad mini, and is priced at RMB 999 for the China line version.

Apple also continues to sell the first-generation Apple Pencil, which uses a lightning connector for the 10th-generation entry-level iPad, as well as some older iPad models, and is priced at $799 for the GB version.

Considering that the current iPad has been upgraded to USB-C ports across the board, the first-generation Apple Pencil is no longer able to charge at the fit, and Apple is expected to launch a version of the Apple Pencil with a USB-C port soon as well.

Also, Mark Gurman said that while Apple is moving forward with new iPad models, he doesn't think the release of those devices "will happen this month."

## Apple computers to use Nimble Island too? The bangs screen becomes a punch hole screen.

The 14-series iteration of the iPhone was a big update, and the new "dynamic island" became the representative of the new generation of iPhones. Now, this eye-catching design may be extended to the rest of Apple's product line.

It has been reported that X-Platform (Twitter) user Carter discovered that Apple seems to have accidentally leaked the icon, and that in iPadOS 17.0.2 (21A351), Apple incorrectly set the default logo to be the MacBook Pro icon with the Spirit Island.

The discovery is undoubtedly exciting, as the image clearly shows the presence of the Spirit Island in the model, and while the Spirit Island on the icon is a whole rather than an i-shape, it is similarly displayed in the iPhone, so it's fair to hazard a guess that Apple will likely equip the MacBook Pro with the Spirit Island.

Previously, it was said that Apple is planning to launch a new MacBook Pro with M3 chip by the end of this year or early next year, if combined with the above news, the upcoming Apple device will be expected to land on the island and will be able to provide relevant software features.

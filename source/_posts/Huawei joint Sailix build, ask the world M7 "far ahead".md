In a distant call, Huawei Yu Chengdong released ask the world new M7, taking advantage of the heat of the Mate60, the new M7 attention to the boat dry, the release of the day after the order hit 15,000 units, the results are encouraging.

As a major revision, the new M7 we had expected more emphasis on comfort, fuel consumption and performance, but Huawei's understanding of luxury cars is often more buttoned down.

The new car focuses more on safety, according to the official statement, the new M7 is "physical safety and intelligent safety double insurance". Once the impression of safety is deeply rooted in people's minds, high-end is the way to go.

It must be said that the new M7 does have the flavour of a strengthened Volvo. In terms of regular upgrades, the new M7 gives a new front design with more ornate light bands, which isn't much to look at, but it's much more recognisable. Length 5020 mm did not change, but in order to reduce wind resistance of the new M7 height reduced by 15 mm to 1760 mm, as a gain is in the battery specifications remain unchanged in the case of the new car pure electric range from the original 135 kilometres and 150 kilometres to 175 kilometres and 200 kilometres, an increase of obvious.

The new M7 currently only has a range-extended version, 1.5T range extender upgraded to 112 kW, single-motor burst of 200 kW, dual-motor version of an additional 130 kW rear-drive motor, the two versions of the zero hundred acceleration of 7.8 seconds versus 4.8 seconds, feeder fuel consumption of 6.85 litres versus 7.45 litres, compared to the old model is unchanged.

The new car adds a 5-seat version, with two rows of seats for better space and storage experience, and a slight increase in configuration, with zero-gravity seats across the board, and most of the configurations are Huawei's own research and development, such as speakers that are HUAWEI Sound, as well as Huawei's AR-HUD and Huawei's MagLink magic suction interface, and so on.

## HUAWEI ADS 2.0 Advanced Drive System.

At present, only the top-end M7 is equipped with LiDAR, which supports the high-order full-dimension system, no dead angle, and can be driven with or without a map, and will fully support the national city at the end of the year, which is a lot ahead of the progress compared to other car companies, and is also a symbol of the strength of the powerful.

In addition to the technology superior intelligent driving system to ensure safety, the new M7 also strengthen the safety of physical force, to the submarine-grade steel, adding CBS composite body materials, all crash tests all G, that is, the top, people can not help but think of the year when the reigning Passat is the collision test does not meet the standard and hiccups cold.

The entire product power point of view, ask the world of the new M7 in terms of product power, comfort and intelligence, indeed more than most of the 500,000-grade car, the only problem may be that the appearance of the design is a little ugly, but the brand is still there, the impact is not great. The new M7 big five-seater compared to the old starting official down to 249,800, six-seater version starting 269,800, the same level and price is also slightly higher models are Toyon, Hananda, which is stronger is actually self-evident.

## AITO asked the world of new products come out, always attract the attention of the industry

Despite the emergence of new car-making forces, the brand created by Ceres and Huawei, the world's leading provider of intelligent terminals, remains a special presence in the field of new forces, so much so that today, people are still talking about the bold attempts made by both partners and the performance of AITO in the field of intelligence after its introduction.

AITO has started "accelerating fast" since its launch, and has released three intelligent cars, namely AITO M5, AITO M7, and AITO M5 Pure Electric Edition, which have gained a good reputation. According to the research, AITO asked the world in the first half of 2023 new energy medium-sized and large SUV quality ranking outstanding performance, AITO asked the world M7 is with good performance, get a lot of car owners strongly recommended. In May this year, the 100,000th complete vehicle of AITO Inquirer rolled off the production line, which means that the brand has achieved a breakthrough from 0 to 1 in only fifteen months. "This represents users' recognition and trust in us, and verifies the success of the Smart Car Selection model." Yu Chengdong, Huawei's Managing Director, CEO of Terminal BG, and CEO of Smart Car Solutions BU, said.

"Accelerated fast running" is still going on, AITO asked the world to continue to "wisdom", in the past 12 September, AITO asked the world of the new M7 was officially launched, the new car is priced at 249,800 yuan - 329,800 yuan in the new car. The new car priced at 249,800-329,800 RMB was upgraded in the aspect of intelligence, among which the intelligent driving and intelligent cockpit are especially worth talking about, and AITO asked the world to refer to them as the "Double Intelligence".

AITO asked the new M7 Max intelligent driving edition equipped with HUAWEI ADS 2.0 high-level intelligent driving system, the system with the vehicle is equipped with 27 perceptual hardware, and high-performance computing platform and Huawei's own anthropomorphic algorithms, can be achieved on the dynamic and static target of the whole scene, all-weather, wide-range perception.

The 27 sensing hardware includes an overhead LIDAR, 3 millimetre-wave radars, 12 ultrasonic radars, and 11 high-definition visual perception cameras, which are equivalent to the new M7's 27 "eyes", enabling all-around observation of the road conditions without any dead angle, and 99% of the obstacles can be identified in fine detail. In the product evaluation, rows of cones and buckets, stationary water horses, earth mounds, fallen trees, and rocks sliding down the mountain are all included in the evaluation scope, and they can't escape from the "eyes" of AITO's new M7. Not only that, the new car is also able to identify foreign objects outside the list of obstacles, with a recognition rate of 99.9%.

Recognition is not the purpose, through the recognition of reasoning, rapid decision-making, rapid response, turn danger into safety is the purpose, "fully armed" AITO asked the world of the new M7 in the accurate recognition of the behaviour of the surrounding traffic participants, can be in the safety, comfort, efficiency in both cases to achieve a high level of intelligent driving, which, of course, including peak traffic flow of This includes, of course, urban and high-speed roads during peak traffic periods; the new car can discover parking spaces and park autonomously without self-learning, thus truly achieving "Visible is Parkable"; and the Sentinel Mode detects potential dangers in the vicinity, and the system will send out an alarm and record a video. ......

## AITO asked the world of the new M7 intelligent both inside and outside,

not only has a "clairvoyance" "wind ear", there is a strong "inner", they are equipped to make the "dual intelligence". They are equipped to make the title of "Dual Intelligence" more apt.

AITO asked the world new M7 equipped with Hongmeng intelligent cockpit 3.0, can achieve mobile phone screen and car screen switch freely, so that drivers feel the magic of space jump, for example, before you get on the car you are playing games, listening to music, brushing the drama, into the cockpit, just touch the link, you can continue to feel the experience through the car screen. The new car can also achieve multi-finger touch arbitrary zoom, free switching tasks, super desktop one-touch, multi-function immediately apparent and other functions, experience commented that it is as smooth as Huawei Mate 60 Pro mobile phone.

Intelligence not only gives the new car a smooth and silky experience, but also enables many other functions, for example, AITO asked the world of the new M7 car navigation support offline map voice navigation, offline map voice navigation recognition rate of up to 99%. For example, AITO's new M7 can help car owners who "forget when they park their car" to find their car accurately through APP. For example, the cockpit is equipped with a key to reserve the car can quickly help the driver and passenger through the "memory" will be the car temperature, air conditioning, through the "soft command" to make the car sound is reduced, so that the car as quiet as a quiet forest comfortable and quiet.

Safety is always a topic of concern for drivers and passengers, AITO asked the world of the new M7 to build a good physical safety at the same time, but also in the use of its intelligent advantages for the vehicle's active and passive safety "secondary support".

In terms of physical safety, AITO new M7 adopts cage body design structure, the whole body submarine-grade thermoforming steel accounted for 24.4%, each square centimetre can withstand 17 tons of weight. The vehicle's door sill beams are filled with aluminium profiles to increase the vehicle's "bone density", and they also protect the vehicle's electric core and battery module. The new car is equipped with eight airbags and front double pre-tensioned seat belts.

## In terms of intelligent "secondary support"

the new car can expand the AEB emergency braking function in the active safety system to support low-speed driving scenarios in the forward and backward directions, covering skidding scenarios and realising low-speed emergency braking; in the case of reversing, it is able to identify the risk of collision, including children, collision pillars, cone buckets, etc. AITO The multi-sensor fusion sensing system of the new M7 can achieve a maximum detection distance of 200m and a horizontal maximum detection angle of up to 120°, which increases the vehicle's anticipation of dangerous situations.AITO's new M7 can increase the maximum braking speed to 90km/h through the AEB automatic emergency braking, which reduces 90% of safety accidents due to inattention and complex road conditions. In the tunnel section, AITO's new M7 can quickly react through the full fusion sensing solution and LIDAR to avoid danger when encountering abnormal weather or falling rocks on the mountain.

The highlights of AITO's new M7 are far more than that, and more highlights need to be felt by the driver himself, and its 249,800-329,800 RMB price tag is also very friendly to consumers. It hopes to truly face the majority of Chinese family users, and really become a "smart affirmative action" instead of "brand premium" high intelligence-price ratio products.

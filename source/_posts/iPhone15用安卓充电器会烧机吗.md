## Will iPhone 15 burn with Android charger?

iPhone 15 series replaced with a new USB-C interface, which is undoubtedly a major change in the course of Apple's development, and I'm afraid that the original lightnning interface will be disappeared in the long river of history.

The change in interface is bound to cause a lot of discussion, although not to the verbal attack, but also has a certain impact. Especially now that the iPhone 15 series has been officially launched, some users have already got the new machine, which will make Apple again become the object of hot discussion.

On the day the new machine went on sale, some netizens found that despite the iPhone 15 series replacing the USB-C port, the Huawei data cable still can't charge it. This topic quickly gathered a lot of attention from netizens and quickly made its way onto Weibo's hot search.

According to the compatibility test of mainstream brands currently on the market, in addition to the Huawei data cable can not charge the iPhone 15 series, the original cable of the VIVO brand can not charge it, while Xiaomi, OPPO and other brands can be used normally.

However, since Apple can work with some Android brand data cables, it is thought that the problem is not in the iPhone 15 series, and the inability to use it may be due to the private protocols of some brand data cables.

In addition to the above topics, today's news about the iPhone 15 series USB-C port rumours have once again caused widespread discussion.

Yesterday, the circle of friends crazy rumour, purchased the iPhone 15 series models of users had better not to use Android Type-C data cable for charging, otherwise it may be burned problems.

Apple iPhones can use most Android brand data cables, some can only be slow-charged, some simply can not be used, but it is unlikely that there is a case of burning. Apple phones are automatically matched with fast or slow charging protocols, and if that charging head or cable does not have Apple's charging protocol, then it will simply not charge.

It is worth mentioning that, although the above situation does not cause the problem of burning, but the charging head should choose to have the national 3C safety certification, the use of cottage high imitation charger is not no quality assurance, there are security risks!

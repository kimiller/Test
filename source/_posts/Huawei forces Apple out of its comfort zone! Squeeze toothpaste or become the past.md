## Ming-Chi Kuo: Huawei forces Apple out of its comfort zone! Squeeze toothpaste or become the past ~

Apple, as the world's premier technology giant, has always been known for its innovation and excellent product power.

However, in recent years, the iteration of the iPhone upgrade is getting smaller and smaller, but the netizens who flirt with Apple's enthusiasm for "squeezing toothpaste" is more and more. The reason for this situation may be that Apple has taken too many steps too fast, so now it intends to slow down the pace.

Want to get rid of such a status quo in fact is not difficult, just need to let Apple have a sense of urgency, with the pressure will naturally have power, and it so happens that now there is such an opportunity.

In today's news, Tianfeng Group analyst Ming-Chi Kuo made a point in the X (Twitter), saying that Huawei's return is actually a good thing for consumers, and that such a strong competitor could force Apple out of its comfort zone, causing it to come out with its true colours and continue to innovate aggressively.

The domestic market has always been regarded as the meat and potatoes, and now Huawei's "resurrection race" to enter the high-end bureau, I believe that Apple will be able to feel the pressure. Even in order to be able to stand firm in the domestic market, to get more right to speak, Apple has to pay more attention to the improvement of the iPhone.

Snipes and clams, the fisherman. Although consumers are not equal to the fisherman, they can still benefit from it. The two companies are competing with each other, which will surely make them pay more attention to the improvement of their own products, after all, the degree of product excellence and market competitiveness has a direct relationship.

In addition to this, Kuo also tweeted that the iPhone 15 is one of the first phones in the industry to feature stacked CIS (image sensors), which Huawei would have implemented by 2023 if not for the US ban.

However, this is just conjecture and prediction, there is no actual evidence to show, so you guys can just watch the fun.

It's worth noting that this analyst is referring to the very same major upgrades in this year's iPhone 15 series.

Both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models feature Sony's stacked sensors in their image sensors, which are capable of further expanding the imaging range, while the iPhone 15 Pro will come with a LiDAR optical radar scanner supplied by Sony as a way of improving the device's nighttime shooting capabilities.

Of course, it's the iPhone 15ProMax's periscope telephoto camera that's the most impressive. With this camera, the iPhone 15ProMax is known to be able to achieve up to 6x optical zoom, which is directly twice as much as its predecessor's mid-range model.
